## What this is not

Before we get into what the PIE Cookbook *is* it might be helpful to explain what the PIE Cookbook is not.

### This is not about creating or managing community

As we have stated before, we are working under the assumption that you are already part of a well defined community. Furthermore, we are assuming that you have a relevant role in that community. Finally, we assume that you have identified that there is a very real need and opportunity for an Accelerator to improve and support that community. Perhaps, you've already experimented with coworking or shared workspaces. Maybe you're already hosting events.

Whatever the case, we're assuming you have a community. You may not yet completely understand the community. Or the finer points of its composition. But you know you have one. 

With those assumptions in mind, we will lightly touch on community development from time to time. But we will try to avoid describing, in depth, how communities are defined, built, and maintained. That topic is another book — or library of books — in an of itself. And with this book, we want to focus on the Accelerator that serves that community.

### This is not about recreating PIE

Let's make one thing clear. We're sharing the PIE Cookbook not as a roadmap, but as a starting point. The last thing we want is to inspire the creation of a bunch of generic technology startup accelerators. The world has enough of those. Trust us.

What the world needs more of are the creative applications of the accelerator process. Of individuals activating the latent value of their respective communities. Of subject matter experts sharing their wealth of knowledge — and wealth of mistakes — with new founders. Of more people making more new mistakes. 

We called this the PIE Cookbook for a reason. We'll give you the base ingredients. But we expect you to make each recipe your own.

## Want to start an accelerator? Don't start an accelerator

You don't get to start in the middle. You have to start at the beginning.

When we started the experiment with Wieden+Kennedy that would become PIE, we didn't set out to build an accelerator. We started with something to support the existing startup community. Something that would fill gaps that were preventing our community from growing and thriving. Something that would enable connections and random collisions and happily serendipitous events to occur. 

Honestly, we just kind of stumbled into the  whole "accelerator" thing. It wasn't even on our list of objectives when we started. Or part of the conversation. It's just where we wound up for a time. But oddly enough — even though we never set out to build an accelerator — we managed to build a very effective one.

This is a recurring theme that we will touch on time and time again in this book. Throughout PIE's life, we have been part of an ongoing series of happy accidents. But those accidents were expected. We designed the project to work that way. To never take itself too seriously. And to always be open to changing the recipe. Even if staying the course seemed safe and sane. We wanted to always be pushing the envelope, exploring the edges, and not getting comfortable. Because that's where some of the most interesting things happen. 

You can do this too. It's not hard. And if you need help, we'll be happy to give you a nudge from time to time. 

PIE is an experiment. 

It started as experiment between Wieden+Kennedy and the Portland startup community to determine how established corporations and startups could work together to mutual benefit. And the project just sort of continued to cascade from there.

Well, honestly, to be more accurate, it was less an experiment in the traditional sense. It was a more a whole bunch of mistakes, failures, and missteps that happen to be punctuated — here and there — by some very happy accidents. And we have lucked our way into some things — once the timing was right and all signs pointed to an opportunity — that enabled us to solve problems for the Portland startup community. By identifying gaps and then building something to satisfy that gap. Again and again. And we're still trying to do that.

Simple, right? Well, sort of. Simple, but convoluted. So maybe give us the opportunity to be your accidental sherpa. To help you along a similarly incongruous — but beneficial — path.

But to get the best results, you have to be similarly inclined to take risks, to fail, and to misstep. Because that's what it takes. Honestly, if you're looking for a recipe that will empower you to create successful accelerator class after accelerator class using a straightforward and simple recipe, you're probably reading the wrong book. Because like the communities, startups, and entrepreneurially minded folks you're looking to help, this process is a series of best guesses and iterations. And you have to be comfortable with that. 

If we had started with an accelerator, we're confident that PIE would have failed. Miserably. And that's why we're recommending that — if you're thinking about starting an accelerator — you do anything but that.

## Start at the beginning

So if starting with an accelerator isn't the right place, where should folks begin? Well, if you skipped straight to the recipes, how about you go back and read the timeline of PIE's existence. Maybe it will give you some clues as to what's coming next. And maybe you'll find commonality in your community that gives you a more appropriate starting place.

Or maybe, just maybe, you'll discover that you're one of the rare few who has already done all of the legwork. One who has completed all of the prerequisites. One of those lucky few strong communities that can, in fact, dive straight into the deep end of the pool. Because they've been ramping up all along. And now you're actually ready to take on that accelerator opportunity.

Don't start patting yourself on the back yet. There's still a ton of hard work ahead of you. But you can keep reading from here. You don't have to go back.

But if you're not there yet, please do not skip ahead. Do not pass go. There is no shortcut. It takes time.

## Building a startup accelerator in seven easy steps

# tl;dr You're not starting an accelerator. You're helping to aggregate and strengthen an existing community.

Caveat: Please don't take this as a roadmap to try to recreate PIE. This is just an allegory. To serve as an example of one potential path.

### Step 1: Found your own company. Or at least work at a startup.

Per Brad Feld's advice in Startup Communities, if you're going to truly succeed in building a vibrant startup community then "the leaders have to be entrepreneurs." Not politicians. Not corporations. Not agencies. Or economic development bodies. Entrepreneurs.

With that in mind, we realize that PIE's journey started when the founders started working in startups. Sometimes as founders. Sometimes as employees of startups. But in startups. 

In the trenches, as it were. Experiencing the insanity that was the dotcom days, firsthand. Being wildly optimistic time and time again about how this time it was going to pay off. How all of the stock options would actually be worth something. How we were going to change the world.

Note: No one said you had to actually be a *successful* entrepreneur. Just an entrepreneur. 

On the surface, this is the price you pay for credibility.

But, more importantly, it's also this time — mired in the struggles of startups — that allows you to see the real problems and opportunities from the trenches. That provides the hindsight. That provides the what-if-ed-ness in your brain. That has rethinking every decision you ever made as a cofounder or employee or consultant. 

That has you thinking like a founder.

Because it's that direct startup experience that will inform the accelerator you want to build, eventually.

I mean, you don't get to build it right now. You've got a long ways to go before that happens. But eventually. When we get closer to your time to build the accelerator. Then. That's when this experience will really help.

But in the meantime, it will really help you engage and understand your community.

Also, let's not forget the most important aspect of that accelerator you're going to build sometime in the distant future after you get through all of the recipes. After you work your fingers to the bone building value for the community. Let's not forget that it's that time working with other startup types, meeting people, and building a network of intelligent and driven folks that becomes the most critical element of this first step. Because it's those people who will provide the foundation for a broader community. A community that will be critical to your accelerator. Because these are your colleagues, mentors, advisors, investors — and more often than not, your potential applicants.

But this takes more than winning at home. It's not just local community. Because building an accelerator requires variety and diversity. It takes more than just local flavor. It takes expansive and extended networks. And a multitude of viewpoints. And getting outside of your comfort zone.

So you have to do the hard work at home. But you also have to be out and about. Visiting other regions. Figuring out how other communities work. Making interesting connections. And bringing value to your community by connecting it to communities everywhere.

So yeah. A little bit of work. But you can do it. 

### Step 2: Participate in the community.

The most important part of beginning to build community isn't throwing the best parties or planning the biggest events. It isn't renting a massive space and inviting everyone to join you. It isn't bringing in dignitaries from around the globe and expecting the community to rally around you. 

Although you may be tempted to try all of these things.  

The most important thing to do when starting to build and accelerate your intended community is to meet the existing community where it is, currently.

Maybe you don't think you have a current community. Maybe the current community isn't shaped like the community you want. Maybe you're unclear as to where this existing community gathers or communicates.

Get to work. 

Because we can guarantee — whether you think there is community or not — that there is community. Tons of it. It's just not evenly distributed. It's disconnected. Broken into different factions. It's in hidden pockets, here and there. Soloed. Presenting as something different than your archetypes.

But trust us. It's there. It's already there. 

And your challenge is to find it. And meet it. Where it lives.

PIE's founders attended coffee gatherings, happy hours, user groups, tech meet ups, startup discussions, open source gatherings, BarCamps, Ignites, unconferences, tradeshows, and on and on and on.

But we also did things far less organized and structured. Sometimes, we just sat in coffeeshops and struck up conversations with other laptop-wielding denizens. We talked to people both in Portland and outside of Portland. Because we needed that diverse network. And diversity of viewpoints. We tried to figure out what was going on and who was doing what.

Did we always fit in? No. Was it always successful? No. Was it clear we were getting any traction whatsoever? Absolutely not.

But we did it. And we did it on the community's turf. Not ours. We tried to provide value and get invited to their gatherings. We didn't egotistically start our own events. 

And in so doing — from that collaborative standpoint — we began to build the a network that would become the most critical component of PIE: a subset of an already vibrant community.

### Step 3: Talk about the community.

There's something about a tree falling and no one hearing it. Community is the same way. You have to talk about it. And blog about it. And tweet about it. You have to connect it. And highlight what it's doing.

Why? Because, for the most part, community is not immediately self-aware. As such, people don't just realize that there's "a community." Unless they're specifically looking for it. And this is true, even if they're deeply involved in that community. 

You have to tell them. And then tell them again. And again.

You have to cheerlead. You have to create a bully pulpit. And you have to use that megaphone to convince those outside of the community that the community is, in fact, real. And to encourage those who are starting to become self-aware of the community to connect more deeply with that community.

You saw folks like Brad Feld, Mark Suster, and Fred Wilson doing — and continue to do — this with their personal blogs. You saw Silicon Alley and Silicon Prairie and GeekWire do this with more journalistic efforts. And if you were in the same communities we were, you saw Michael Arrington do this with TechCrunch. To ridiculous effect. 

For us in Portland, those vehicles were things like Silicon Florist, our personal blogs, larger tech blogs outside of our region like TechCrunch, local publications, and the — then nascent — social media landscape. All served as the means of talking about the Portland startup community. And to spread the belief that it existed and had the potential to be much, much more.

Yes, Virginia, there is a Portland startup community.

Note: This step is ongoing. You don't get to stop talking about the community. Ever. Keep going. Keep talking.

### Step 4: Invite the community in.

Now that your community is gaining definition. Now that it is starting to solidify and formalize. Now that you are taking an active role within that community. Only now can you start to host events. Shine a spotlight on talented community members. And invite people who would benefit from hearing those community members. Renny did this by having W+K serve as the inaugural host of Ignite Portland. And hosting events like Portland Lunch 2.0, among others.

Without—and this is critical—expecting anything in return. At all.

Don't think that you have to acquire space before this happens. You can partner with existing spaces. Or pay to rent spaces that you make accessible to others. Or this can occur in a shared space or a known resource.

You don't have to own the space, but you must do what it takes to make space available to the community.

With PIE, we were lucky enough to own space. Which had been generously donated by our patron, W+K, as part of the experiment. So we hosted community gatherings that we didn't manage. We invited people into the space. We had them hold their events in our space. We let people crash out overnight for crazy caffeine fueled coding sessions. Heck, we even hosted the first ever 30 hour nonstop livestreamed Web telethon in the space to help the community raise money for charity during the holiday season.

We made the PIE space a resource by the community, for the community.

### Step 5: Create a common space.

Events are great. But truly valuable community spaces are leveraged as a utility, all day, every day.

For PIE, forming a coworking space was the way to go. In part because Wieden had given us the space to do it. And in part because we thought it was what our community needed. It ensured that the space was being used throughout the day while making it available for events in the evening. Plus it gave the space ongoing and sustainable energy. Everybody wins.

Maybe your community needs the same thing. Or maybe it simply needs an event space that it uses throughout the day. Or maybe it needs a coffeeshop or a brewpub. Who knows? Maybe it needs a multistory complex that houses everything from startups through established businesses.

We don't know what your community needs. It's your community. There is no right answer. Or, perhaps more appropriately, there is no one answer that is right for every community.
Your task is to find the answer that solves an actual need within your community. And to find the partners and patrons who are going to help you get there. You need to create the space that your community needs to continue to thrive. And to continue the momentum you, as a community, have created.

For us, the space in the Wieden+Kennedy building afforded us opportunities for coworking and hosting events—which in turn provided all kinds of value for the community. In retrospect, there are three things we found to be most important about having a physical space:

1. As different groups in the community took advantage of the space, it created an opportunity for random collisions to occur and serendipity to thrive—from W+K and giant global brands to nascent startups. We found that those collisions created real and sustainable connections.
2. It provided a vantage point for us—the startup community and our patron—to better understand the dynamics of the community, where the momentum was, and where the gaps were. At times, it also provided us with an opportunity to simply observe, as an objective third party.
3. It served as a physical representation of the community, as a whole. So when folks were visiting town or were new to town, they had a place to land. And that space enabled others to discover and engage with the community more readily.

### Step 6: Keep doing all of that stuff. But do more of it. Faster.

Now that you've got some momentum, you've got a working space, and you've started to define your role in the community, you have to really get to work. Or maybe you have to build something else. But you get the gist.

There's more to do.

In addition to hosting, you now get to start programming your own events. And using your network to make those events interesting, engaging, and valuable. But bear in mind, that this event programming has to occur in collaboration with — not in competition to — the events we mentioned in Steps 2 and 4.

It's incredibly important that these events fill gaps. Not replicate existing content.

With PIE, we created our own programming and invited folks to attend. We held hackathons that combined the startup community with the creative community and corporate community. We offered our space for coworking sessions for the "friends of PIE." Even if that meant giving space away.

In short, we were on the constant lookout for interesting opportunities to bring our networks together. For talks. For gatherings. And for all sorts of collaboration. Because connecting our disparate communities and adding value to the broader community is what helped us establish our space as valuable, needed, and sustainable.

And then, only then, were Renny and I ready to…

### Step 7: Start an accelerator.

Now that you've done all of that work, you're ready. I mean, if it's even still needed.

At PIE, we absolutely needed to start an accelerator. The community needed it. W+K needed it. Startups needed it. Individuals needed it. First a bullhorn. Then a coworking space. Then an accelerator. Because we needed it. As a community.

But if you discover that — after all of your hard work — an accelerator is not needed, that's okay too. No one said that having an accelerator was a requirement.

Again, this isn't the right way to do anything. This just happens to be how PIE came into being.

Whatever you choose to do—start a long journey or jump into the deep end of the pool—just remember that, in the long run, you're not building an accelerator. You're building a community.

## Coworking and Community Development are not complementary

When we started PIE, we were working under the assumption that "coworking" — the concept of a variety of companies and individual contributors sharing a common workspace — and "community" were synonymous. Get a bunch of people sitting and working in the same space and viola! Community. 

Nope. Coworking and Community are not synonymous. In fact, at times, they may even be at odds with one another. So even if you've got a thriving coworking business, don't assume you have a community. If your coworking business is thriving, that actually may be an indicator that you don't have a community. Conversely, if your coworking space is struggling to make ends meet, that may also be an indicator that you're doing okay with community development. 

You see, sometimes communities need to embrace people who cannot afford the cost of a desk. And sometimes communities have to turn away individuals who can afford to pay.

It seems counterintuitive but we’ve learned that giving startups desks for free often creates a tighter bond and stronger commitment than asking them to pay. That is, they perceive more value in the offering than office space to be more valuable than simply cash out of pocket. They feel like a valued part of the community. And since a very important part of our role is strengthening community, we feel this emotional tie has far more value that the rent check.

Long story short, we feel we’ve gotten exponentially more value out of giving desks away than we ever would have by adding a few more dollars to the revenue stream. And whatever the case, don't assume the health — or lack thereof — of a business pursuit like coworking is a direct or even relevant indicator of the health of your community. We've seen many a healthy community without the financial health to sustain a coworking space.


# Kitchen Prep

Where you start is where you start. Don't let the current state of things or the amount of effort required prevent you from taking action. Start small. Start today. It might not be where you want to start. But you've got to start somewhere.

# Before you begin

It is important to understand that an Accelerator is simply a tool. It is not inherently positive. It is simply a means to an end. At PIE, we always say, "We're an accelerator. That's not always a positive thing. We have the potential to help accelerate your success, but we can just as easily accelerate your company into the ground."

At PIE, we dove headlong into the effort with a bunch of assumptions. Among those assumptions was the ideas that when one of us used a particular word, we all had a similar concept for what that word meant. We were wrong. And it caused confusion and stress. 

So we learned that it was important to diffuse those assumptions by taking some time to establish context and vocabulary for what you're trying to accomplish. Below, you'll find an example of the definitions we used to explain the different elements of the PIE community.

## Definitions

Like many industries, the startup world is rife with terminology that holds special meaning to individuals who are well versed in its own cryptic lexicon. For that reason, we often fall into situations where we assume we’re on the same page as one of our similarly immersed counterparts. And — like most assumptions — that can cause problems. We believe that communication and clarity are vital, so we’re always looking for ways to get everyone speaking the same language.

We feel that it is extremely important to have a consistent set of language to describe the concepts and participants in this process. Without clear definitions, we run the risk of miscommunication — even when we think that we’re speaking the same language.

For that reason, we're going to provide you with some definitions of terms that are regularly used throughout the PIE Cookbook. Please note that, like all things in this document, we are simply providing this as a reference. We would encourage you to create your own set of definitions for your community and for your accelerator's specific needs.

### Community
Community can refer to any group of individuals who hold common goals and are motivated to collaborate to achieve those goals. There is no specified size for a community. And communities can be nested within other communities — or overlap. Therefore, it is always important to test the assumptions and continually re-evaluate the ends toward which the "community" is working.

> e.g., The Portland technology community has subsets like the Portland open source community and the Portland tech startup community. There is significant crossover between the participants in the open source community and founders and employees in the tech startup community. But, at the core of those communities, they do not share the same goals.

A community simply has to have a focus. It can revolve around concepts, ideals, goals, brands, or any combination thereof. We see community, at its essence, as a group of people with a shared, collaborative vision.

### Accelerator

An accelerator is a semi-protective environment that behaves as a microcosm of the real world, at a highly increased rate of speed. It is designed to help founders better understand how to deal with trends, personalities, and adversity in the real world. It is also designed to support founders in rapidly addressing issues impacting their businesses.  

> Accelerators are not designed to protect founders from the elements of the startup world. They are designed to expose founders to those elements, time and time again in rapid succession. 

To quote Techstars, accelerators, by their very nature, are designed to help companies "do more, faster." They are designed to make founders uncomfortable. And to push founder to do and achieve more — or fail — more rapidly than they would be capable of on their own.

Accelerators are unsuccessful when they allow unproven founders or products to survive longer than they reasonably should. Failed companies are not a "failure" of an accelerator. In fact, accelerating a company toward failure, sooner rather than later, is one of the most important functions of an accelerator. It saves founders time, money, and emotional stress by helping them recognize that the timing simply isn't right for their pursuit.

### Incubator

An incubator is a protected work environment designed to shelter founders and ideas as they work to realize concepts and prototypes in an effort to bring a functional product to market. 

In our definition of an incubator, there is no "business" yet. There are simply ideas and potential.  

Incubators are designed to help early stage ideas survive longer than they would in the wild, without the shelter, care, and feeding of an incubator. As such, an incubator does not strive to accurately reflect the stressors and turmoil of the real world. Instead, it seeks to shield founders from reality by providing resources that best ensure its likelihood of finding commercial applications of its concept(s). This is by design.

> e.g., University tech transfer programs tend to be a good example of incubators

Incubators are unsuccessful when they fail to provide adequate support for the founders engaged in their programs. Failing concepts are not a "failure" for the incubator. They are simply a recognition of the fallacy of the pursuit.

While the terms "incubator" and "accelerator" are used interchangeably, we see them as very different and distinct pursuits. 

Throughout this document, we will only be focusing on the Accelerator model but Incubators may find some of the content helpful for their day-to-day operations, as well.

NOTE: Although PIE has "incubator" in its name, that's a misnomer. We started as an incubator and transitioned into an accelerator. We chose not to rebrand the effort. Or maybe we simply couldn't come up with an acronym that worked. Except PAELLA.

### Startup

How, exactly, does one define a startup? Well, honestly, we could write a-whole-nother book on that question alone. So rather than get into the particulars, we're going to simplify our definitions.

At a macro level, we tend to define a "startup" as any company that: 

1. Has the potential for exponential growth
2. Lacks the resources — be it product, staff, capital, experience, market knowledge, business acumen, or otherwise — to fuel that exponential growth
2. Has yet to experience a significant liquidity event

For the sake of this book, a "startup" will be any company with whom your Accelerator engages in the activity of acceleration. Simple as that. It is important to note, however, that we will often use "company" and "startup" interchangeably throughout this book. When discussing more established companies such as sponsors and patrons, we will often refer to them as "corporations" or "brands."

# tl;dr Your Accelerator is inhabited by Startups. And it may be assisted by Corporations.

### Founder/Cofounder

Founders — often referred to a Cofounders when part of a founding team — create Startups. So Founders are the folks with whom you will be working. They're the person or people who were motivated to solve a problem and start a company. Often, Founders come in teams, but there are solo Founders, as well.  

# tl;dr Founders are the individuals on whom you will be focusing your Accelerator efforts.

Sometimes, Startups have already hired Staff. While this does not necessarily preclude them from participating in an Accelerator, we have found that the bulk of the Accelerator's effort is focused on assisting the Founders of the company, rather than the Staff. 

> NOTE: At times, an Accelerator must designate activities as "Founder only" — specifically excluding Staff, Mentors, Advisors, and Investors — to ensure that those activities provide a protective environment of trust for Founders in the Accelerator. Managing this exclusivity will be critical to an open and collaborative cohort.

### Mentor

Obviously, as an early stage startup accelerator, we spend far more time with mentors than advisors. In our world, we define a Mentor as an individual who volunteers his or her time to provide a startup with opinions, criticism, and feedback on problems, opportunities, or quandaries.

# tl;dr Mentors are volunteers who provide opinions to Founders.

Mentors tend to provide feedback in the form of “If I were in your shoes…”, “Here’s what I’d suggest…”, or “I remember being in a similar situation. Here’s how we handled it….”

Therefore, mentors should…

- Give first
- Volunteer their feedback free of charge
- Provide feedback on a wide range of issues and opportunities with the startup
- Speak from previous experience tempered with a knowledge of current market conditions
- Openly share mistakes and missteps from their past experience
- Remove their “brand hat” or “title” as needed, i.e., sometimes a mentor is “a CEO” and sometimes that same mentor is simply a “user,” “successful business person,” or “someone who has seen a lot.”
- Float in and out of a startup’s purview, enabling the mentor to provide fresh perspectives on problems as they change
- Be used en masse to simultaneously provide a variety of viewpoints on specific problems or opportunities — the more opinions, the better— even if it winds up causing the classic “[mentor whiplash](http://avc.com/2013/07/mentorinvestor-whiplash/)”

### Advisors

Conversely, we define an Advisor as an individual who is compensated —either in the form of equity or cash — by a startup in exchange for effort on solving a specific issue with the company or who is charged with assisting the founding team with a variety of issues.

# tl;dr Advisors are compensated to do work for Startups.

Therefore, advisors should…

- Always be compensated for their efforts
- Work to earn that compensation
- Focus on specific areas that are in the advisor’s wheelhouse
- Provide strategic value to the startup that is recognizable to potential investors or other advisors
- Be expected to contribute effort to solving problems
- Be held accountable for contributing time to the helping a startup make progress or resolve issues
- Be used by the startup in a fashion that is equitable to the amount of compensation
- Provide more than advice or guidance
- Continue to provide value to the startup throughout their tenure

## Pick the right person for the job

> The primary difference between a mentor and an advisor is that the former is chiefly tasked with providing opinions on problems and the latter is tasked with resolving those issues.

To recap, if you’re working with a **mentor**, ask them for advice, not effort. They’re volunteers. They’re not being paid to help you. They’re providing their insights with the hopes that others will not have to suffer the same pains the mentor has.

If you’re working with an **advisor**, it’s fine to ask for advice, but you should also expect them to do work — and hold them accountable to that expectation. And you should recognize that they are a direct reflection on you and your company. Don’t take on advisors on a whim. Anymore so than you would take on a cofounder lightly.

Mentors volunteer; advisors are paid. Mentors advise; advisors work.

### Investor

Folks have a tendency to lump all investors together. However, when you're dealing with a specific stage of company, it's best to be more granular about the types of investors with whom that company will be interacting, both in the short term and in the future.

At the most basic, an investor is someone who is using either personal capital or someone else's capital to make investments with the long-term objective of creating more money than they started with. 

https://twitter.com/turoczy/status/777181970782523393

A common misconception is that it's an investor's job to "give people money" or "cut checks." It is not. An investor's job is to leverage their assets to create an appreciable return on investment. This is important to note because, in many ways, the investor with whom you will be dealing is in a very similar predicament to the startup founders with whom you are dealing. They are often two parties using someone else's money to build a business.

We used the following definitions to describe the investors with whom we had a tendency to interact. 

A note about capital: We'll use "capital" in the broad sense, but you should recognize that many investors — especially those at later stages — have at least two distinct capital resources at their disposal. A portion of the fund is dedicated to making the initial investment in a company, establishing the relationship between the investor and the company. Another portion of the fund is often dedicated to follow-on capital. This is the money used to prevent an investor's position in the company from being significantly diluted. 

Therefore, Accelerators operating with only initial investment capital must be comfortable with the concept of their position being increasingly diluted in future rounds of funding. To allay this, Accelerators may raise funds to go to follow-on rounds or they may partner with other investors to help protect the Accelerator's interest. Another tactic some Accelerators employ is introducing "anti-dilution" clauses into their agreements that prevent dilution from happening. Or assigning Warrants for future equity purchases. At PIE, we have found this practice — especially for new or little known Accelerators — to make future fundraising more difficult for  companies. So it's not something we'd recommend.

#### Angel

An Angel is an individual who invests his or her own money in an early stage company. This investment could come as early as a "Friends and Family" round (defined below) or as late as a "Lettered" round (defined below), though more often than not, Angel check sizes generally have them participating sooner rather than later, ranging from low five figure checks to six figure checks, depending on the Angel and his/her investment strategy. Some Angels choose to make a series of small bets; others choose to make a significant investment in a single company. Some Angels are comfortable investing on their own; others prefer to invest with other Angels or as part of an Angel Group (defined below).

NOTE: It is important to understand individual Angels and they're preferred investment strategies, because they run the gamut.

Due to the stage at which they are investing, Angels are often required to make judgments based on the founders of a company and the Angel's understanding of the product and market. This is because Angels are usually engaging before the product has been completed or before the product has been taken to the market. 

Some Angels are described as "true Angels," where the investor bases the investment decisions on the founders and appeal of the product whether or not that investment has a high likelihood of paying off in a significant way. These are individuals who are supporting both the founder and the community by using their capital. This type of investment is not charity, but it is goodwill in that it often lacks the rigor or due diligence of other investments. It's an "I like you and I think you're going to make something happen" sort of investment.

Angels often invest in industries where they made their money. So it is important to understand the Angel's pedigree before engaging him/her as a potential investor. 

> e.g., If an Angel made his/her money in food and beverage, it may be unlikely that they will feel comfortable investing in a technology startup.

#### Angel Groups

Angel investors will sometimes collaborate with other Angels to pool funds, get access to more deal flow, or share due diligence with one another. We refer to these collectives as "Angel Groups." Angel Groups may be in a position to write larger checks from pooled funds than individual Angels would be willing to commit. 

Angel Group check sizes range from individual Angel checks at low five figures 

One of the benefits of Angel groups — to both investors and startups — are the inherent efficiencies of these types of organizations. Rather than having to speak to each Angel individually, a startup can pitch the group, en masse. Likewise, instead of an Angel having to chase down a bunch of deals, they can rely on the organization to line those deals up for the Angels.

Another benefit is that it enables Angels to invest "outside of their comfort zone," thanks to the trust in their peers.

In addition, Angel Groups provide a means of educating first-time or inexperienced Angels on deal flow, due diligence, and investing.

Long story short, because these organizations can be structured in a variety of ways, it is important to understand how the Angel Group is organized. 

Some important questions to ask:

- How are decisions made?
- Is there a pooled fund or do Angels invest individually?
- Is there shared due diligence or is each Angels doing his/her own?
- Can Angels choose to invest individually, independent of the decisions of the group?

#### Syndicates

A Syndicate is a venture capital fund often composed of a group of Angels led by a single dealmaker designed to make a single investment. The model is predicated on the idea that the dealmaker is a trustworthy source of deals and that is a good judge of opportunity. 

Members of the Syndicate agree to invest capital when the dealmaker invests capital. 

Why is this even a thing? Well, it has two benefits. One, like Angel Groups, it simplifies fundraising from the startup perspective. They can focus on pitching Syndicate leads with the hopes of gaining the investment of the entire Syndicate. For the Syndicate lead, helping source deals provides them with a the benefit of participating in the carry, like a traditional fund, which provides an additional upside should the deal prove lucrative. 

#### Accelerator Investment

- While it is not a requirement, many accelerators chose to invest capital in the startups participating in their programs. Some of these investments are structured as traditional equity purchases while, these days, more accelerators seem to offer convertible notes as the structure for investment. Y Combinator uses a vehicle called [SAFE (Standard Agreement for Future Equity)](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/). 

Some programs choose to provide all of the capital at once. Some programs provide a small amount of capital at the outset of the program, followed by a more significant investment once the company completes the program.

#### Micro Venture Capital

Micro Venture Capital tends to be funds of under $100 million that invest in early stage companies often before typical institutional investors would participate in a deal. Check sizes vary for these types of organizations. It is important to note that these funds often reserve follow-on capital to protect their positions.

#### Traditional/Institutional Venture Capital

Most accelerators will only work with traditional venture capital in the role of mentors for their programs, given that large funds do not generally invest in early stage companies. That said, having later stage investors involved in the program can be extremely beneficial as a means of preventing problems before they start or helping guide startups on conversations that will occur in the future. 

What's more, it's always best to start these conversations sooner rather than later. And it's always nice to have conversations about money and expectations when neither party is currently in a position to engage with one another — rather than at the awkward point where the startup is in dire need of capital.

#### Corporate Venture aka Strategics

Corporations with venture arms most often choose to make strategic investments in companies at later rounds as a means of strengthening partnerships or market position. You often hear these investments referred to as "strategic investments." As such, Corporate Venture groups are sometimes referred to as "strategics."

Most accelerators will only work with corporate venture folks in the role of  mentors for Accelerator programs, given that corporate funds do not generally invest in early stage companies. Like traditional VC, it's better to establish these relationships before a capital need arises for the startup. 

#### Private Equity

Private Equity firms provide a means of creating a liquidity event without an initial public offering or acquisition by another company. 

Most accelerators will only work with private equity folks in the role of mentors for their programs, given that private equity does not tend to invest in early stage companies. Again, it's always best to start these conversations sooner rather than later. 

# tl;dr Traditional VC, Corporate Venture, and Private Equity can be good sources of Mentors for Accelerators because there is likely no immediate transactional opportunity for the participating startups.

### Investment rounds

While it's a bit of a shifting target, it is important to distinguish each type of investment round and the stages at which companies should be pursuing these kinds of investments. The following are a broad definitions using the common lexicon of the stages of rounds of equity investment. 

> NOTE: We are providing the definitions PIE used. Your results may vary. 

#### Friends and Family aka FFF (Friends, Family, and Fools)

The "Friends and Family" round is generally the first round of funding many startups pursue. Whether it be a nest egg that the founders have tucked away, small checks from family members, capital from a friend who has a little cash to spare, or someone simply intrigued with the idea who is willing to take a flyer, this is the capital that allows founders and potentially team members to leave their day jobs and focus on their startup full time. With Friends and Family, the primary objective is providing working capital that facilitates the effort of developing a prototype.

This is often short-term capital that lasts months, not years.

#### Pre-Seed

Pre-Seed is often the first "official" round of funding. In our lexicon, this is the round where Accelerator funding — the equity purchase you are likely to be making, should you choose to do so — falls. It's the capital that provides the founders with runway to take a prototype and find product-market fit. Or to refine the prototype until that fit can be found. 

Other investors who may participate in these rounds are individual Angels and very early stage Micro VCs. Friends and Family investors may continue to participate in this round, especially if they have received pro rata rights.

Again, this is often short term capital that lasts months, not years. More "keep the company alive" capital than "grow the company" capital.

#### Seed

Seed is often the first significant infusion of capital into the company. Currently, this infusion comes when the founders can demonstrate that their concept or prototype has potential in a specific market. This capital provides the runway to take the product to that market and establish traction and, hopefully, revenue. 

Seed funding often comes post-Accelerator. Investors in Seed rounds include Angels, Angel Groups, Syndicates, and Micro VCs. Traditional VCs may also choose to participate in these rounds. Again, previous investors with pro rata rights — like an Accelerator — may also "re-up" in this round.

This is longer term capital designed to fuel company growth, rather than just keeping the company alive. 

#### Lettered

Lettered rounds (A, B, C, etc.) are what most folks think of when they talk about "venture capital." These rounds are the money that keeps the company growing, supports the company as they struggle to grow, helps them address new markets or market changes, allows them to acquire complimentary or competing companies, and address any number of other "costs of doing business" which may not be covered by the revenue the company generates. 

As the rounds progress, there are more and more investors involved, either early stage investors providing "follow-on capital" to retain their positions or new investors seeking an equity stake in promising startups. 

As an Accelerator taking equity, Lettered rounds are where you will experience the most dilution of your ownership position, unless you have significant follow-on capital at your disposal for defending your position in the company.

 
### Resident

At PIE, we introduced the concept of a Resident, that was different from the Startups participating in the program. A Resident could take any of the following forms in our environment:

1. **Mentor in Residence**: This designation was reserved for Startups who had participated in an Accelerator class and then remained in our coworking space. In exchange for a rent-free existence, Mentors in Residence were obligated to work with Startups in the active Accelerator class, providing them with guidance and insights that would make the program more effective, e.g., "Make sure and meet with this mentor," or "Don't pay attention when Rick throws that tantrum," or "I remember when were struggling at this stage."
2. **Startup in Residence**: PIE started as a coworking space. As such, when we transitioned to an Accelerator, we had a number of companies who resided in our space, participated in peer mentoring and assisting one another, but who had not officially participated in an Accelerator class. We found these more objective startups so valuable, that we continued to invite Startups in Residence to hang out in the space even after the original startups had outgrown the space. Sometimes these startups would be at an earlier stage than the participants. Sometimes they were startups that had already completed another Accelerator program. Sometimes they were startups that had recently relocated to Portland and just needed somewhere to crash for a bit. Whatever the case, having these peers as resources for our startups always proved beneficial. 
3. **Investor in Residence**: Some of the residents of the space weren't even startups. They were investors who spent time with our startups, providing connections, criticism, and feedback to our startups. And the value of that different perspective provided a unique vantage for our companies and helped them better understand the investor perspective. If you have the opportunity to engage with investors and have them share your space — even if it's only a limited exposure — it's still incredibly valuable. 

### Patron

With PIE, we were very careful with the language we used to describe our primary underwriter, Wieden+Kennedy. Because they, as an organization, were consistently more concerned with soft returns on their investment — education, on the job training, and serendipitous connections. It wasn't a financial, hard return for W+K. And so the language we chose was designed to reflect that. 

We always referred to W+K as a "patron" rather than a "sponsor." Our reasoning? We meant it as a compliment, in the same vein as those benefactors who saw the value of providing financial support for artists to pursue their work — without any guarantee that that expenditure would result in anything more than creative exploration.

# tl;dr W+K is the Patron for PIE. And anything we've accomplished is only due to that generosity.

### Sponsor

At PIE, we saw Sponsors as benefactors who provided capital for the operating costs of an Accelerator with the expectation of a measurable return for that capital. The money from Sponsors was not put to work by  making equity investments. Rather, it was used to pay for space, staff, services, and other costs associated with the day-to-day operations of the Accelerator. This helped Corporations participate in the Accelerator without the complexity of engaging as Investors.

In return, these Sponsors expected something. This is what makes them different from Patrons. Patrons assume that something will come of the investment eventually. Sponsors expect that something demonstrable will come of the investment at the outset.

Sponsors worked with PIE to cohost events, embed staff as mentors, receive consulting from PIE staff and startups, and the like.

### Partner

We define Partners as an entity that provides a product or service to the organization in an effort to promote that product or service. For Accelerators, these Partners tend to be the folks who provide the "added services" that create additional value for your Accelerator. 

Partner agreements are neither equity nor capital based. Instead, they are often based on "in kind" contributions to the Accelerator or its Startups.

A good example of a Partner is a hosting service that provides a limited number of "credits" for free hosting on its platform with the intent that Startups will remain on the platform and become paying customers once the credits are exhausted. 

## So why did we force you to work through all of that?

Why all of the definition setting at the outset? Because the more context you have going into the situation — the more clarity and the more consensus — the better you'll communicate. And the fewer misunderstandings you'll have. And the more likelihood you'll have of success.

Now that we've defined the terms of the types of players in the ecosystem — or those completely absent from the ecosystem — it's important to describe and define the environment in which your accelerator will exist. Otherwise, how will you know what you've got at your disposal? Or what's missing?

## Environmental scan

You may anecdotally understand the community in which you exist, but it's always  good to survey a number of participants to determine the true composition of your community. 

We recommend an environmental scan. It doesn't have to be exhaustive but it does have to accurately reflect reality. This isn't an optimistic look at your community. It's the truth. 

The more honest you can be, the better off your accelerator efforts will be.

As part of this scan, you should be working to answer questions like:

- What assets/resources does your community have?
	- How mature are they? Have they been around a while or are they relatively new?
	- Are they currently accessible or are they largely inaccessible?
- Where are the gaps in the current community?
	- Are they solvable?
	- How entrenched are they?
- What types of companies generally find success in your area, independently of any support? Are there particular themes? (In PIE's ecosystem of Portland technology startups, for example, companies tend to excel at enabling technology and frameworks. To put it another way, Portland tech startups tend to be developers building tools for other developers.)  
		
Once you've captured a variety of detail, create one of those annoying Venn diagrams. Because those things are a thing for a reason. They actually can help you visualize where the opportunity exists. It might not be where you think. But it's that point of overlap where you have the highest likelihood of success. 

It doesn't do you any good to try to build an accelerator full of consumer facing products that require tons and tons of capital if you have neither consumer facing expertise nor tons of capital. That's a losing proposition.

First, play to your strengths. Once you have momentum, then you can get visionary.


# Cooking

Let's start with this. First and foremost, the primary objective of any Accelerator should be to **create an environment of trust that accelerates creative output**. That is the most basic way to describe it.

Founders trust you to help them make sense of this whole startup thing. To be honest with them. To say the hard things that need to be said. To connect them with the expertise that helps them continue. Or the insight that helps them to quit. 

But it's not just startups. Mentors trust you to engage them, if and only if, it will be worth their time. Investors trust you as a filter to help them mitigate their risk. Media trusts you as a means of identifying interesting companies and trends. People who dream of starting a company one day trust you as a resource to support them. 

It's a whole bunch of people looking for something in which to trust. And that trust is hard earned. And easily lost. But that is your role. To be the trusted — and fairly objective — third party. To be the trusted advisor. To everyone.
 
A close second to an Accelerator's role of establishing trust? Reality. 

As we've highlighted in the definitions, an Accelerator is not designed to be a protective environment. It is not a fantasy world. That's what Incubators are for.  

Accelerators are about reality. 

Therefore, the environment you build should be a representation of the outside world, not a utopian existence. Why? Because your objective is helping founders understand how to survive and prosper in the real world. Or, tangentially, to understand the harsh environment of reality is not the right environment for them to be pursuing their company.

## Order of progression

When you're first starting, the progression should look something like this: 

- Founders, which leads to securing 
- Funding, which enables you to afford
- Space and 
- Staff, which allows you to recruit 
- Mentors, which become the primary means of attracting 
- Startups. 

In terms of the amount of time you'll spend on each of these phases, the rank order looks more like this:

1. Mentors
2. Startups
3. Funding
4. Staff
5. Space
6. Founders 

# Base ingredients

In our experience, there are three critical components to supporting and maintaining a sustainable Accelerator: community, funding, and promotion. 

Without **Community**, there will be no resources upon which to draw. You don't use an Accelerator to create a Community. You use a Community to create an Accelerator.

Without **Funding**, there will be no operating capital for the Accelerator, whether that Accelerator chooses to invest in its startups or not. There needs to be capital for the space, the staff, and the infrastructure to support the Accelerator. 

Finally, and often most overlooked, is **Promotion**. Without promotional efforts, the applicant pool will suffer, the caliber of mentoring resources may be impacted, the interest from Venture Capital may be lackluster, and the potential for startup success may be diminished. 

So let's take a look at each of these critical elements in more detail. 

## Community

While we've defined a generic form of Community, each particular Community is different. Some are collaborative. Some are competitive. Some have an embarrassment of riches. Some struggle to make ends meet. Some have a wealth of knowledge. Some lack the expertise they need.

None of these aspects of the Community ensures your success nor dooms you to failure. They're just aspects of your Community. That said, you need to know those facets of your Community so that you can leverage the resources you have and accommodate for the strengths you lack.

A lot of these details will be anecdotal. As a participant in the Community, you'll have a good feel for the composition of the Community. But again, an Environmental Scan will help you better understand the opportunities and challenges within your Community. 

Some questions to ask about your Community:

- How do you define your community? 
- What are the objectives?
	- Shared
	- Conflicting
- What is the expertise (if any)?
- What are the weaknesses?
- What are the silos?
- What are the issues?
- What are the gaps?
- How can they help (if at all)?

## Funding

At PIE, we get a lot of questions about how to fund accelerator operations and investments. It makes sense. Finding the money that matches up with the opportunity is a challenge. It’s never easy. No matter how compelling the pitch. 

Like a Community, these benefactors will have certain goals that motivate them to engage with your Community. Some of these may be in line with the Community objectives. Some of them may not be in line. You may find some benefactors who have capital to contribute but are at odds with the Community. And you may find potential benefactors who don't even realize the opportunity availed by supporting an Accelerator.

Whatever the case, your job is to find the value equation that provides value for your Community and the benefactor(s) while providing the financial wherewithal for supporting your Accelerator activities.

Again, some questions to ask: 

- What are the objectives of the potential benefactors?
- What is their expertise?
- How can they help? Is it only financial or are there other opportunities for collaboration?

A benefactor can take any number of flavors — or potentially several flavors. (Note: This isn’t an exhaustive list. But it gives you a pretty good idea of where to look.)

In our observations, there are four types of folks who fund accelerators. Sometimes they’re actual, well, folks. Sometimes they’re companies. Sometimes they’re angels or venture capitalists. But here are the buckets into which they seem to fall: Patron, Sponsor, Partner, Investor.

### Patron

As defined above, a Patron is a benefactor who engages with an Accelerator without a specific outcome in mind or in an effort to better understand the Accelerator's given community.

In PIE's case, our primary Patron was Wieden+Kennedy, a global creative firm. The motivation for W+K to provide operating capital and in-kind resources for the Accelerator was motivated by a desire to gain a deeper understanding of the startup community and the creative process of early stage founders.

Later in the project, we discovered other ways to engage with W+K. Some of these went beyond patronage, like when they became early stage investors in our accelerator companies. Some of them were an extension of patronage, like when we engaged with members of the creative  team to provide services for our startups. 

However, throughout the course of the project, the main motivation remained one of patronage, a desire to engage and learn from early stage tech startups.

To the Accelerator, a relationship with a Patron provides much needed operating capital, another party who is interested in the success of the Accelerator and its residents, and a sounding board for the management of the Accelerator. It is important to note, however, that defining a Patron's goals and metrics for success require assistance from the Accelerator, as well.  

The most important consideration with a Patron is not mistaking another type of benefactor as a Patron. It's critical that you have a clear understanding of the expectations of any benefactor with whom you engage.

### Sponsor

A Sponsor provides financial resources for the Accelerator in exchange for specific outcomes. These outcomes are usually defined as objectives prior to the sponsorship occurring. 

Sponsor dollars are used to support operating costs of the Accelerator. They are not generally used to make equity investments in Startups.

In PIE's case, we generally worked with corporate Sponsors to help underwrite the costs of PIE. Some of these Sponsors collaborated with PIE to manage events that facilitated collaboration between the Sponsor and the startup  community. Other sponsors took an active role in the Accelerator as Mentors. 

Choosing the right Sponsors can be a challenge for Accelerators. Like any investor, it is important that a Sponsor's desired outcomes are in line with the objectives of the accelerator and that achieving those outcomes has a high likelihood of success during the normal operations of the accelerator.

A great example of an effective sponsor relationship is the "Powered by Techstars" model that Techstars employee with corporate sponsors. With this sponsorship arrangement, Techstars and the corporation collaborate to ensure that the Accelerator program is meeting the needs of the corporate sponsor. In addition to capital, the corporate sponsor provides validation and market expertise for the Techstars program. 

### Partner

Partners are organizations that support the Accelerator program with resources rather than direct capital. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement that is generally used as a loss-leader for Partners.

It is important that Accelerators are careful with partnerships, because poorly constructed partnerships could be detrimental to startups going through the accelerator program. 

Even in situations where the Partner is tightly integrated into the Accelerator, it is important that there are other entities to balance the influence of the Partner. An example of this is the Techstars "Powered by" programs, where the Partner and the Sponsor are often one and the same. In this situation, Techstars provides the balance that balances the Accelerator. 

One of the most prevalent examples of an Accelerator partnership is the [Amazon Web Services Activate program](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/). With this partnership, AWS provides an allotment of free credits to each company in the Accelerator. This allows startups to build on Amazon infrastructure without any out-of-pocket costs. In return, AWS has a higher likelihood of converting those startups into paying customers once the credits are exhausted. 

### Investor 

Investors collaborate and fund Accelerator activity in an effort to improve deal flow, identify companies that have a better chance of succeeding, and gain additional validation of product market fit. The filtering that Accelerators provide, therefore, can result in a very symbiotic relationship for both parties. 

Given the similarities of VC behavior and Accelerator behavior, however, it is critical that these arrangements only occur between parties whose goals are completely aligned. It does an Accelerator absolutely no good to accept funding from a VC whose investment thesis does not match the Accelerator's. And it does a VC no good to invest in an Accelerator that does not provide beneficial deal flow or services.  

On the upside, venture capital can be a very effective means of funding Accelerator activity, because they are used to playing in the space of startups.

- Used to spending money on risky efforts
- Have a time horizon that is in line with company maturation
- Have the potential to provide follow on investment.
- Ongoing portfolio management can be super valuable for the continued success of your companies.

On the downside, this funding mechanism can curtail the experimental nature of an accelerator if VC is the only backing. 

- VCs are in the business of making money. 
- The relationship will be driven by financial motivations. Will likely be only interested in investing in. Companies that have the highest likelihood of returning capital to the fund. Companies that best match their investment thesis.

This sort of focus can hamstring accelerators and incubators who may see promise or opportunity in verticals or companies that are outside of the fund’s purview. 

Long story short, you don’t get to “experiment” with VC money. You get to make money. An Investor will only be motivated to engage with your Accelerator if it results in return on that investment.

**500 Startups hybrid model**

While we don't advocate for making Founders pay to participate in an Accelerator program, we are fans of the creative collaboration between Investors and Program that the [500](http://500.co) Program ([Don't call 500 an Accelerator](http://500.co/the-artist-formerly-known-as-accelerator/)!) has put together. 

In the 500 model, the fund invests in the company. Then the Seed Program charges for participation in their Program. This ensures that the Startup has working capital and a cleaner cap table, the fund has an equity investment, and the program has operating capital. 

> We invest $150k in exchange for 6%. We charge a $37.5k fee for participation in the 500 Seed Program.

## Promotion 

aka Soapbox(es) or bullhorn(s) or campfire(s) or promotional platforms or whatever you want to call them

One of the things that dawned on us in hindsight was the value of having  platforms for sharing opinions, promoting our efforts, and conversing with our community. 

It seems straightforward and obvious, but it's often overlooked. 

You need a soapbox. Or a bully pulpit. Or a bullhorn. 

You need some way of amplifying your signal. And some way of communicating effectively with the community you're engaging. 

There are any number of examples of these kinds of platforms. It could be an email list or a blog. It could be a series of events. It doesn't even necessarily need to be something you "own." It can be a social network presence. It could be a local publication that assists with your communications. It could be a blog run by someone else who wants to cover your community. 

But whatever the case, you need that promotional and conversational outlet. To engage.

At PIE, we used [Silicon Florist](http://siliconflorist.com/) as our initial platform, because it already had a following in the community with whom we were interested in engaging. Twitter, which had an early following in Portland, was also an extremely beneficial platform in this regard. First with personal accounts, then with a PIE account. Eventually, we adopted email, a PIE blog, Facebook, Instagram, and Medium, as well. We also used the space, itself, as a promotional platform by creating our own events and hosting others. Now, Github has become a critical component of our platform, thanks to the PIE Cookbook. And we've added Slack to the mix, as well.

Admittedly, things were much more simple we started. We didn't have a great deal from which to choose. There were blogs and Twitter. And had the opportunity to watch new platforms come online, assess how they were being used, and then choose to adopt those platforms if and only if they showed promise in our community. 

You, my friend, have got a much wider and frenetic breadth of options from which to choose, these days. And they all have their idiosyncrasies and communities. 

So we encourage you to approach your platform choices with these questions:

- Where does your community go for information and conversation, today?
- What publications or organizations talk to the same communities you do?
- Are there certain platforms that your team simply enjoys using more than others? (If you don't like writing, starting a blog is the wrong idea. But maybe a podcast or a YouTube channel would be appropriate?)
- What are the one or two platforms which would be most successful with the least amount of effort? Just because all of the platforms are there doesn't mean you need to be on all of them. Look for efficiencies.

## Other critical ingredients

Like any recipe, there are main ingredients and the ingredients which add flavor or make the dish. So while you could likely build an Accelerator with the base ingredients, we highly recommend adding some of these other critical ingredients to your Accelerator recipe.

### Mentors

The most critical of these "additional ingredients" will be your mentors. These are the assets that will actually make your Accelerator work — or fail. So we'll spend a great deal of time on this topic. 

It is important to understand that there are different types of mentors, different ways to apply each mentor, and different motivations for the mentors to participate in the program. It's also important that you understand the best ways to recruit, manage, and reward your mentors for their participation in your program.

Let's start by outlining the general categories of Mentors, bearing in mind that Mentors can often fall into multiple categories. 
 
#### Non-resident Mentors

Non-resident mentors are the most common mentors for an Accelerator. They engage with the Accelerator on an as-needed basis. They do not reside in the Accelerator space. Rather, they are invited by staff to present or meet with Founders. 

Non-resident mentors run the gamut of experience from founders to subject matter experts to potential customers. Again, PIE holds the firm belief that anyone can be an effective mentor. So we will continue to emphasize that it is **experience**, not **expertise** that helps qualify a Mentor. Anyone has the potential to be a Mentor if applied properly.

**Role and expectations**

Non-resident mentors will do the bulk of the mentoring within your Accelerator. After all, they comprise the bulk of the "network" to which your startups are seeking access. And they are the asset your organization will put to work, most often. 

That said, your Accelerator should have very low expectations for the amount of time that these mentors will be able to contribute to the organization. They should be used for efforts that can be completed in under an hour. And those efforts should be fairly remedial from the mentor's perspective. 

You should expect that these mentors can answer questions off the cuff from the startups. They should not be engaged on issues which may take additional effort or meetings with this type of mentor. 
 
**Value to the accelerator**

These mentors provide any number of benefits to the Accelerator, but among the most prominent are:

- Providing guidance and feedback to the Startups within the Accelerator
- Helping to promote the Accelerator and its offerings
- Helping to recruit Startups for each program
- Helping to recruit additional Mentors for the Accelerator
- Assisting in the selection process
- Providing objective feedback to the Accelerator about both the startups and the accelerator, itself

**Value to the mentor**

While the accelerator and startups are gaining value from the mentor, it is equally important that you understand the value the mentor derives from participating. 

- Strong connection to startup community
- A feeling of giving back to the community
- Recognition as an important asset to the community
- Reaffirms experience and expertise
- Connections with other mentors
- Dealflow and due diligence for potential Angel investments

**Value to the startups**

These mentors, by and large, are the reason that the startups joined your accelerator, whether they know it or not. It is the advice, criticism, and connections that these individuals provide which will enable these companies to succeed — or help the startups determine that there is no chance of succeeding.

**Typical percentage of the mentor pool**

Non-resident mentors should comprise the vast majority of your Mentor pool. Likewise, this category of mentor should serve as the initial means of "test driving" mentors for other types of mentor roles.

#### Lead mentors

Lead mentors are individuals who take a particular interest in one of the companies in the cohort. That level of interest motivates the mentor to meet with companies on a regular basis and suggest other mentors who could provide valuable feedback to the startups.

We have found that it is difficult to pick or establish lead mentors at the outset of the program. Rather, Accelerators have to monitor the potential for lead mentors and when appropriate, suggest to both the startup and the mentor that both would benefit from more regular meetings.

#### Mentors in residence

We’ve tried any number of models: paid desks, free desks, desks in trade. What has worked best for us, as an accelerator, has been the concept of free desks for “mentors in residence.” 

This is usually reserved for people who have been through the program, but it’s also been used for companies like Sprintly, Automattic (WordPress), and Upworthy. We established a soft baseline for participation (“You have to be actively engaged in mentoring startups in the space.”) And assessed and judged that participation anecdotally. Those not meeting our expectation were counseled to up their mentoring game or encouraged to leave the space. We gave them a few warnings.

Why do we believe this is an effective model for PIE and other accelerators? At the core, accelerators are about knowledge transfer. Retaining class participants beyond their cohort allows us to more efficiently transfer that knowledge (“You shouldn’t miss that mentor talk,” “You definitely need to connect with so and so,” and “I couldn’t help hearing you were having an issue with x. Here’s how we dealt with that.”)

# Mentoring the mentors

Around the time [PIE](http://piepdx.com/ "PIE") was starting the accelerator phase of this ongoing experiment, [David Cohen](http://twitter.com/davidcohen), cofounder of [TechStars](http://techstars.com/ "TechStars"), shared the [TechStars Mentor Manifesto](http://www.davidgcohen.com/2011/08/28/the-mentor-manifesto/ "TechStars Mentor Manifesto"). And it served as an inspiration for me. [A post by Micah Baldwin](http://learntoduck.com/techstars/good-mentor/ "8 Rules To Being A Good Techstars Mentor"), a former TechStars mentor , provided a similar nudge for me.

I’m often reminded to go back and reread both of these posts. And am inspired, again and again. So I thought I’d take the opportunity to augment the PIE mentor guidance a bit with some things that we’ve learned from observing PIE startups and mentors over the years.

We shared these tips with the PIE mentors and a few of them suggested we turn it into a blog post for the broader mentor community.

So we took that mentoring to heart.

If you’re thinking about becoming a mentor for startups — either in a formal accelerator program or independently — here are some tips for thinking about how to work with entrepreneurs.

## 10 tips for mentoring startups

### 1) Common sense is not common.

Mentors often worry that they need to come up with some earth-shattering insights to be of value. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Fact of the matter is that you spend day-in, day-out working in your area of expertise.

> You make intuitive leaps that are all but impossible without having had the experiences you’ve had.

All of that — all of that built up knowledge — is of incredible value to an entrepreneur who is in the middle of a maelstrom of activity. Or who hasn’t yet gained the experience. So think of the simple things. Think of the obvious. And share those insights.

Because your common sense is not common.

**“Common sense” is not common**

As I was working on my “Mentoring the Mentors” post for PIE, I recalled an older piece of mine where I dug into the whole “common sense” fallacy. It seemed timely and, potentially, helpful. So, I’m sharing some of those thoughts, after a little bit of refreshing the content.

> Common sense. It seems so, well, common.But fact of the matter is that it’s not.

I mean, common common sense is prevalent. I’ll give you that. Those widely held understandings. And things that most people seem to know. Sense that is common across a community or population. Yes, that exists. Common common sense is common.

But your common sense? Nope. Not common, at all.

You see, your common sense is different than everyone else’s common sense. And that’s because your common sense is based on the experience and insights that you have derived from doing the same thing, day in and day out. Or by being part of something for a period of time. Or from repeatedly trying, failing, and iterating.

> Your common sense is a byproduct of your focus, your vantage, and your experience.

And because of that, it is completely subjective. In fact, even if I were doing exactly the same thing you’re doing, day in and day out, the same things that are obvious to you wouldn’t necessarily be obvious to me. Even worse, I might have my own cadre of common sense that I thought you should already know.
Common sense is, counterintuitively, uncommon.

So that stuff that seems so obvious? It’s not. And that forehead-slapping “What is that person thinking? Isn’t it obvious that you do [or don’t do] that?” response you have on a regular basis? Whatever it is that is so painfully obvious to you may not even register for the person you’re observing.

Like it or not, we are all victims of the “curse of knowledge.” And that’s really difficult to shake. And it’s nearly impossible to unthink or unknow.

And that’s why, be it for business or mentoring or whatever, I am constantly challenged — and fail regularly — to do two things:

#### a) Stop assuming intuitive leaps have been made.

I have a really bad tendency to assume that everyone has already thought about what I’m thinking about. As such, I assume that they’re making the same intuitive leaps I am. So I don’t say anything. Or share thoughts.

The problem with this is that — more often than not — they aren’t making those leaps. It’s not because I’m smarter. (That, I can guarantee.) It’s just because I’m working with my set of common sense. So, even if it feels like I’m backtracking, I’m working to start with the reasoning behind my thinking. To ensure that everyone is on the same page.

What’s more, I’m really trying to focus on beginning at the introductory level — the 101 — and go from there. Without being pedantic or dismissive. Because you can’t just jump into the deep end of the pool and assume that everyone knows how to swim.

#### b) Over-communicating what I think I know.

If I’m not sure where my peers stand, then the onus is on me to be more effective at communicating. And I need to be more conscious and deliberate about sharing my opinions. No matter how small our company or our organization, we should be over-communicating when telling one another what is important, how we think things should be done, and how we have learned to get there.

Even better? We should be documenting what we know to provide a common lexicon for those discussions and a foundation for new folks entering the fray.
The value of our common sense lies in the very fact that we have produced it from our unique vantage. And because of that we need to, first, understand that it has very real and intrinsic value, even if we don’t perceive that it does. And second, we need to do a better job of sharing it and not assume that it’s common.

> We need to get away from assuming that “Everyone else knows this stuff. I’m nothing special.”

You know more about what you do than I do, or he does, or she does, or they do. In fact, we’re all incredibly ignorant of your unique flavor of common sense. And we would all be better off with you sharing those insights which you incorrectly assume we have already had.

> That thing that seems so completely obvious to you? It isn’t to the rest of us. Your common sense isn’t common.

### 2) Your mistakes are often more valuable than your successes.

While sharing your victories can be motivating for startups and entrepreneurs, being open about your failures and mistakes can often be more helpful. The stumbles and downfalls are the things that caused you to lose sleep, to stress, and to doubt. Share those. So that everyone can learn from them.

> Mistakes are why you changed what you were doing. Failures are the things that taught you how to do your job.

We always say that PIE is about “making new mistakes.” There are two reasons: 1) If startups are repeating mistakes our mentors have already made, we’re failing them and 2) If the startups go out and make new mistakes, then they can come back as mentors to prevent others from making those mistakes.

### 3) You don’t have to know everything.

You were asked to mentor because of your experience. And because you’re awesome. But that doesn’t mean you need to know everything. Nor does it mean the onus is on you to know everything.

> You know what you know. Share that.

You’ll be surprised at how seemingly simple things can drastically improve a startup’s potential and perspective.

### 4) You are more than your role or profession.

This one became especially clear with our corporate mentors. Sometimes, you have to take off your “brand hat” and put away your business card.

> Sometimes, your most valuable feedback comes not from what your company would say but from what **_you_** would say.

You are an incredibly talented individual who has made it to the position you’re in because of the decisions you’ve made. And its your insight and intellect that guided those decisions — that brought you to your current role. Sometimes, just being you and providing personal advice can be incredibly beneficial.

### 5) Know your limitations.

Don’t over promise. Don’t under deliver. And don’t get yourself into a mentoring situation that has you feeling stressed. An hour of your time is valuable. If that’s all you have to give, that’s all we’re asking you to give.

> Don’t make this a chore. Mentoring is a reward.

It’s the opportunity to share what you’ve learned. And to prevent others from making the mistakes you’ve made. It should be seen as such.

### 6) Advise as if you were an employee.

Mentors are often driven individuals who have attained their position through sheer determination and hard work. They’re often people who take the wheel and try to steer others in the right direction. And they’re used to leading.

> But your role here is not to lead. Your role is to advise.

And fact of the matter is that — no matter how vehemently you support or oppose an entrepreneur’s decision — in the end, it is his or her decision to make. Not yours. And s/he has to be the one to make it. Not you.

We take this from the vantage of an employee or consultant advising his or her superiors. “This is my opinion on what should be done, but you’re the boss.” Mostly because I’m fairly sure I’ll be working for one these entrepreneurs one day.

### **7) Be honest.**

While mentoring can be a lot about bolstering the outlook for new entrepreneurs and motivating them to change the world, that’s not the goal of mentoring. The goal of mentoring is positive. But the path may not be.

> The most valuable mentoring comes from being honest. Not nice. But honest.

Sometimes, your feedback will be negative. Sometimes, your feedback will be difficult. But it should always be honest and critical — in both the positive and negative sense of the word.

### **8) You can’t fix everything. Nor should you.**

You’re not here to rescue anyone. You’re here to provide startups with feedback. And you’re here to challenge them. That’s all we ask. If you want to take an entrepreneur under your wing, please feel free. But don’t feel obligated to solve their problems.

> Your job is to push startups to solve problems themselves.

More often than not, the problems you see haven’t even dawned on them yet. So tell them. But don’t try to fix the problems for them.

### **9) Take it personally.**

We want you to be invested. We want you to be happy and frustrated and proud and confounded. We want you along for the roller coaster ride. We need you to take this personally.

> As a mentor, what comes from your gut and your heart is often more important than what comes from your brain.

At times, it will be completely aggravating. But that means you’re taking it personally. And that’s what these entrepreneurs need.

### **10) Mentor one another.**

You’re not just here to give. You’re here to get. It’s a two-way street. So talk to other mentors. Get advice from the startups. Get advice from your peers. Get advice from anyone in the community.

> If you see another mentor in need of guidance — in need of your common sense — then pull them aside and share it.

And be equally willing to listen when another mentor wants to impart their knowledge to you.

**Good luck. And thank you for giving back.**

# Notes on mentoring

"Accelerator" can be a misnomer, in some cases. Accelerators are actually about slowing down, making connections, and contributing to community. They're about making busy people focus. About creating lines where there are only dots. 

If they accelerate anything, they accelerate connection. For both those mentors who choose to participate. As well as for the founders who are selected. 

We need to stop focusing on accelerating business and spend far more time and energy accelerating connections and value. For founders. And for our community. 

Mentorship is messy. And honest. And weird. Because it is human. 

It does not scale. It cannot be automated. And yet, if left to its own devices, it won't happen. Mentorship rarely happens organically.

It doesn't have metrics. Or milestones. Or process.

But it does have technique. It does have examples. And guidelines. And guardrails. For both the mentors and those being mentored. And for peers.

## In Practice (via @eighteyes)
Mentoring is an alignment of perspective. Here, you have to take the life experiences of another person, and have them understand your perspective. As a mentor, you must take the time to know a person, how a person thinks, what their experience is. A handy way to approach this is to speak about complicated material in the form of metaphors.

### Metaphors are powerful teaching tools (via @eighteyes)
Think about when you have learned a difficult subject. When it started, you had a slight familiarity with the subject, say 20% of the related material was understood. Here you stumbled around in the dark, with prior knowledge and experience as a candle lighting the way. Then you find it, that one critical insight your mind needed to begin to understand the other 80%.

Metaphors can help to provide that critical insight by bridging the experience gap using imagination.

> Example: 'Marketing is like a river. It is comprised of millions of little efforts, or drops, which gather in different channels, or tributaries, to bring customers to your business, like cargo to port'

From here, you have a framework to begin to explain the practices of Marketing to someone with no experience. This is done by translating the language of a particular industry into a reference they are familiar with so you can begin to have a conversation about more abstract topics.

### Industry Language (via @eighteyes)
As professionals, we depend on language to determine the expertise of others and evaluate our own progress. If a designer is talking about figure-ground relationships, while a data scientist is talking about k-clustering, they each may have a passing familiarity with the expertise of the other, but not the deep experience necessary to truly understand what it means to work with these ideas. 

As a mentor, is important to have a deep understanding of one or several subject matters, and a conversational familiarity with others. These are all touchpoints where you can convey your experience to someone else, using terms and ideas they already understand.

### Share freely (via @eighteyes)
Entrepreneurship often involves the challenge of connecting discrete ideas, so during a mentorship it is extremely important to share whatever information seems relevant, even if it is not topical to the established mentoring relationship. Knowledge does not fit neatly into boxes, it broadly crosses many connections. You never know what may `click` for someone else, it is best to flow with the conversation instead of following a script.

### Learn Openly (via @eighteyes)
One of the amazing things about people is that everyone sees their own connections and brings their own experiences. Young people especially, are more fluid in their thoughts, and have more free time to deeply pursue interests. Make time to listen, when you're scheduling time to talk. 

# Applying Mentors

In order to make the experience most valuable for the mentor and most valuable for your founders, it is important that you define the mentor role and the expectations you have for that mentor before they are introduced to Founders.

For example, if you want a mentor to assist as a subject matter expert, make sure they are given the appropriate platform for conveying that knowledge. Don't make them present if a workshop is a more appropriate format. Don't make them take 1:1 meetings if their knowledge is relevant to every company — and will result in them repeating the same advice to 10 different companies. 

# tl;dr Be thoughtful and respectful of how you use Mentor's time. 

# Time commitment

Once you’ve chosen to work with a mentor, your most important job is to understand that mentor’s level of time commitment. Some mentors will want to help but have absolutely no time. Other mentors will be willing to show up for office hours several times a week. It runs the gamut. Your challenge is making the best use of the time they are willing to commit so that they are deriving value from their participation.

## Sliding scale

At PIE, we found the best way to help assess a mentor's availability was to present the engagement options as a sliding scale. On that scale, the minimal level of commitment was fairly low and the maximum level of commitment was decided by the mentor. There's was no high bar. Just a lowbar. 

Just as importantly, we used other well know Mentors as examples of time commitment bands — "Mentor X generally presents onetime per class; Mentor Y holds regular office hours at PIE every week" — which provided even more context for their potential engagement. Plus, when a Mentor hears that one of their peers or someone they recognize — "[Mentor name] at [Startup] has done this to great effect and is consistently one of our most popular mentors" — they are given more context for how others are volunteering to do.

# tl;dr You must be this tall to ride. Set your mentor time commitment as a low bar, not a high bar.  

At PIE, our lowest time commitment — our low bar — was "Be willing to grab coffee with one of our startups. Roughly 20-30 minutes. One time." That was it. Thirty minutes of commitment per year. And you're a PIE mentor.

At the upper end of the scale were things like, "Work out of the space on a regular basis and be open to interruption, as if you were one of the startups," or, "Be willing to take one of the companies under your wing and meet with the Founders consistently over the course of the class."

In every case, we began the conversation with "What are you hoping to get out of mentoring?" And "How much time do you feel you have to volunteer?"

In many cases, we were lucky and humbled to have Mentors consistently increase the amount of time they spent with our Founders — even if they originally thought they could only spare 30 minutes a year. 

# tl;dr Mentoring is addictive. Mentors will often find they enjoy it more than they thought.  

## Mutual respect

And if you do it right? You’ll find they’ll be a lot more willing to commit more time to the program in future class. Culture of trust and all that. 

Respect mentors’ time and they will repay that respect with more time.


# Speed dating vs Matchmaking

When it comes to mentor engagement, no topic is more ripe for discussion — and more likely to rile opinions — than the pros and cons of speed dating and matchmaking. But before we get into that, let's explain what we mean by the terms.

## Speed dating

With the speed dating format, either startup or mentor is assigned an area within the accelerator, usually a conference room or section of a larger worker area. For this example, let's say it's the Startup Founders. The other party — in this case, the Mentor — is assigned the task of moving from station to station to meet with the other party. This usually occurs on a very short timeframe, most commonly between 10 and 30 minutes. 

There is usually a smattering of mentor types, expertise, and skills in these situations, given people's busy schedules. It's often a "we'll take who we can get" approach. 

The process is designed to make efficient use of time for both mentors and startups, giving each party the chance to briefly meet the other. And to give mentors a general lay of the land for the cohort as a whole. It also avails the opportunity for each party to identify folks with whom they would like to be working.

From the Mentor's perspective, progress goes something like this:

- Mentor 1 meets with Startup 1
- Mentor 1 meets with Startup 2
- Mentor 1 meets with Startup 3…

From the Startup's perspective, progress looks more like this:

- Startup 1 meets with Mentor 1
- Startup 1 meets with Mentor 2
- Startup 1 meets with Mentor 3

So as you can see, the best number of mentors to schedule for a speed dating session is less than or, ideally, equal to the number of Startups in your Accelerator. Too many, one way or the other, and someone's time is being wasted. Too few, and its value is questioned.

But what if you have three times as many mentors wanting to participate as you have startups? That's right. You schedule separate sessions. In this case, you schedule three separate sessions. They could all occur on the same day. But divide the mentors evenly among your startups. It just works best. 

# tl;dr Speed dating works best when the Mentor to Startup ratio is 1:1

Don't try to have multiple mentors sit down with each Startup. That can be awkward for both the Startups and the Mentors. Unless… they already know one another well.

We've experimented with groups of mentors meeting with Startups in this round robin fashion. It's another way to handle a large number of mentors meeting with the Startups, in an efficient fashion. But we've found that these Mentors need to know one another on a collegial or friendly level before this works. Otherwise, comfort levels tend to compromise the value of this model. 

Where we have found this permutation effective is with Angel groups and Venture Capital partners and/or associates. You can group three Investors from an Angel group or VC, together — especially ones who know one another well and who use a similar due diligence style — and they'll do just fine. That said, the Startups may feel a little ganged up on. 

# tl;dr Speed dating between groups of Mentors and Startups works if, and only if, the Mentors know one another well, like Investors from the same group or fund.

In our mentoring experience with other Accelerators, we have found that many programs lean heavily on speed dating. This can have its drawbacks.

### The dark side of speed dating

While speed dating seems to be the most efficient way to engage mentors and startups, in PIE's experience, it does have its drawbacks. So we encourage folks to use the speed dating model in addition to other means of engaging mentors, rather than relying on speed dating as the only means of introducing mentors and startups. 

These drawbacks, which we'll cover in more detail, include but are not limited to:

- Mentor and Startup fatigue
- Perceived lack of meaningful connections
- Perceived lack of tangible results
- A feeling of "missed opportunities" or time wasted by both Mentors and Startups 

## Matchmaking 

While speed dating can be an effective way of engaging multiple mentors with multiple startups, simultaneously. It does, as we have highlighted, have its drawbacks. 

In our experience, matchmaking provides a far more beneficial and rewarding experience for both the mentors and the startups. That said, matchmaking requires far more effort and engagement from accelerator staff.

With matchmaking, the connections between mentors and startups are less serendipitous and more intentional, based on a series of factors, such as:

- Current problems plaguing the founders
- Stage of the product or company
- Skill set and expertise of the mentor
- Personality of the founders
- Personality of mentor
- Likelihood of availability

There is no set day or timeframe. Staff introduces the startup and mentor and leaves it the startup to schedule the meeting. Staff then follows up with both mentor and startup to understand the outcomes of the meeting and to help decide next steps. 

## So which is it? Both.

Unfortunately, there is no easy answer. It's a balance of both types of mentoring.

Why? Well, in our experience, we've learned that each model has its pros and cons. That is why we have always opted to run a hybrid model. Most accelerators try to do the same.  

# How to activate mentors

At PIE, we used four different means of activating mentors by getting them engaged with startups. How we worked with the mentors depended on both the mentor preference as well as the startup's or founder's immediate needs.

We’ll take you through each of these elements from least amount of engagement to most engagement between founder and mentor.

# Preparing mentors to speak to a class

One of the most important — and regularly occurring — activities of any shared coworking space accelerator is a mentor speaking to the class as a whole. For some accelerators, this can happen sporadically. For others, in can take place several times a week. 

At PIE, we found a cadence of two talks per week seemed to be the best. But if there were serendipitous opportunities — for example, a random mentor popping into the space or visiting Portland — we took the opportunity to have them speak. Variety, am I right?

## Initial misconceptions

In our experience, we've found that there are a few misconceptions some communities have about speakers. So we wanted to dispel those immediately.

### Mentors who want to speak are the mentors that should speak

Despite rumors to the contrary, there will likely be a large contingent of your community that actually enjoys presenting in front of an audience. They enjoy the stage. And they enjoy public speaking. And as your program — or programming — becomes more prominent and recognized, these folks will seek out your program. 

Sometimes they're amazing speakers. Sometimes they're not. There is value in each of those outcomes. 

Amazing speakers really help the startups. Not so amazing speakers can provide great conversation points for the startups and staff. 

But don't think you have to take all comers. Like so many things that happen in the chaotic environment of the accelerator, you have to determine if the timing is right. For the content. For the personality. And for the startups. Because wasting a good speaker at the wrong time is just as bad as having an off topic speaker at the wrong time.

### Mentors who don't want to speak shouldn't speak

While shouldn't you take all comers, the converse is also true. Sometimes, you have to seek out the mentor who doesn't want to present in front of the class. Because they have valuable insight. Or interesting stories. Or the startups simply need to have a little boost.

Act accordingly.

While it may take more cajoling and prepping, it is critically important that you always find the right speakers. Not just the speakers to which you have immediate access.

### Mentors need to be expert

Another misconception we will attempt to address time and time again is the idea that mentors need to be expert. We believe that anyone and everyone has the potential to be a mentor. Likewise, anyone and everyone has the potential to speak as a mentor. 

Expertise is not a prerequisite. Insights, willingness to share, and relatable stories are. So find the people who can talk honestly about their experiences. Whether they are considered "experts" or not.

### Speaking is more important than listening

We find that some of our best mentor speakers are those who spend less time presenting and more time conversing or purely listening. So make sure to find folks who are comfortable with that dynamic. 

You're much better off to have a so-so presentation with a lively Q&A session than to have a polished oratory followed by crickets. 

Startups are in your program to explore opportunities, question assumptions, and get their hands dirty. Not revel in theory. So make sure they have speakers who draw that conversation out.

### You need a formal setting for presentations

We talk to a lot of folks who dodge the whole speaker thing with, "Well, we don't have anywhere to do it."

Bullshit.

PIE's mentors had, arguably, one of the most thankless presentation platforms ever. A cavernous concrete room. With huge columns. And a scattered litany of desks. 

Tough room, as the comedians say. We made due. 

And I would argue that the very nature of the raw space lent itself to more candid discussions. That forcing founders to pull back from their desks and wheel their chairs away from obstructions caused them to be more engaged. That even those founders who remained intently typing away throughout the presentation gained something. Because they were immersed in the moment.

The best stage is the stage you have. Make due. 

## Coaching the mentors

Once you've selected a mentor to speak, it will benefit both the community and your program if you adequately prepare them for the talk. 

Even the most seasoned CEO with a completely polished pitch can become a babbling idiot when trying to describe how they built the business — or how they failed. But those are the stories that provide the most value to the startups you're trying to help.

### Encourage mentors to tell stories of failure and mistakes. 

Why? Simple. You can’t recreate the same success. But you can avoid the same mistakes.

Any founder could tell you the entire journey of his or her successful company — step by step in intricate detail. You could take scrupulous notes, ask for clarification and additional color, and document each and every step of the journey with complete precision. 

Then you could carefully, methodically follow that guideline, note for note. Without falter. Down to the most seemingly insignificant detail.

Would that enable you to launch a successful company exactly like that successful founder? Of course not. 

Because for all the control and precision — for all the efforts and decisions of the founder — there are an untold number of additional factors weighing on that success. Timing. The market. Collaborators. Whether it was raining or sunny. 

It could have been the market. It could have been the timing. It could have been, well, luck.

No matter how much you know about what led to success, you can never recreate it. And while those stories are great and inspirational and all that. Sometimes, they’re simply not helpful.

Now what if, instead, you explored things that failed? Would you fail in the exact same way? Probably.

Because failure is a different story. Knowing the story of failure will enable your startups to better understand how things go wrong, how bad decisions come about, and how those things can be avoided. Or, at the very least, they’ll know that similar decisions have a high likelihood of failure. And they can go into the situation with their eyes open.

Ask founders to talk about mistakes and failures? Won’t that be difficult? No. It won’t. And if it is then that’s likely a red flag that you have chosen poorly. Or the wounds are still too fresh. That you should save that mentor for sometime in the future. 

You see, entrepreneurs love the stories from the trenches. Because they're not actually stories about failure, at all. They're stories about perseverance.  To talk about how they battled against all odds to win. About how they managed to string things together and come out on top.

It’s part of the culture.

Talking about naive decisions and stumbles and screw ups. Sharing awful fucking mistakes. And heartbreaking failures. They aren’t pretty. But to other entrepreneurs they are way more important than recounting the completely random lucky set of circumstances that landed you where you are today.

Because unlike that celebrated and yet unrepeatable path to success, avoiding those failures and mistakes can be critical to your peers.

Wisdom isn’t always about winning. And if you’ve created an environment of trust in your accelerator, these stories will be pure gold to your startups. Or the sustenance that keeps them going.

### Trying to use this format as an educational platform is extremely challenging, if not ripe for failure (and not the kind of failure we want)

### Be prepared for Q&A to be awkward

### Being engaged is better than being polished

### Don't sweat the slides

### Don't make it a sales pitch

# Bad actors

One of the most challenging things about attempting to manage community — and then activating that community in the form of an accelerator — is the presence of bad actors.

When we say "bad actors," we mean individuals who are more interested in personal gain than the gain of the community or the founders in your program. It happens. Sometimes it's intentional. Often it's not. 

So how do you deal with it? 

Well, we recommend follow Brad's advice in Startup Communities. The community has to be open to everyone. You have to welcome everyone. And you have to build the type of community that rewards good behavior. And discourages bad behavior. 

But even with all of that working, bad actors still enter the fray. So what to do?

Honestly, from an accelerator standpoint, sometimes bad actors are more beneficial than one would think.

Let's provide an example. 

One class of PIE, we had arranged to have a serial founder come into to present to the class. The founder was currently employed by another company and, as such, took our invitation to mean we were interested in hearing about that company. And not the founder's journey with previous companies.

Shame on us for not setting the context correctly. Lesson learned.

With that misunderstanding as the impetus, things went from bad to worse. With and swirling schedule and multiple overlapping commitments, the founder canceled at the last minute. But rather than leaving us hanging, the founder decided to send an alternate speaker. The person the founder sent was a salesperson for the company.

So through no fault of the founder and no fault of the salesperson, we wound up in a bad actor situation. 

Our founders showed up dutifully to hear a founder talk about their experiences, challenges, and failures. But what they got, instead, found was a sales pitch for a product they neither wanted nor, honestly, needed.

And no matter how much staff would try to redirect the speaker — "Hey that's great. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what it's like to be in a sales role for this kind of company…?" — the sales pitch continued. "What do you do when an audience isn't receptive to your sales pitch?" Still continuing. "When do you walk away from a pitch?" And on and on. 

There was no derailing it. 

So when it was over, the staff scurried to tie it off and hustle the speaker out the door.

The PIE founders were, understandably, miffed. And any number of conversations were sparked by that experience. Some were critical of the program for allowing it to happen. Some were critical of the company and the former founder for sending that presenter. And some were upset that the presenter did not clue into the environment. 

It became a running gag for the remainder of the class.

But you know what? It resulted in a lot of good conversations. A lot. Like an irritant creating a pearl, the poorly placed and unintentional bad actor had not only created a context for interesting discussion, the salesperson had unintentionally become a common enemy against which every one of the founders in that class could rail. 

It went from a negative to a teaching moment.

Best of all, it occurred in a safe environment. Somewhere that the founders could discuss what happened. And discuss why it happened. And why it was bad. And that made it incredibly valuable on any number of fronts.

And with this happy accident it dawned on us that these founders were going to encounter these situations out in the wild — in the real world. And now, thanks to this awkward and aggravating experience, they would be better equipped to handle similar situations when they occurred after these startups were released into the wild. 

And so we started introducing bad actors intentionally. To recreate those interesting moments of conversation and learning.

# Space


## Create a Minimally Valuable Space

At PIE, we're huge fans of coworking. Despite its detractors. And critics of the open floor plan. Heck, we started as a coworking space. We get it. 

We think that coworking — as a model — works uniquely well for building and reinforcing the connective tissue that makes a community a community. That same connective tissue that, over time, becomes the muscle that supports a thriving ecosystem. 

It might not work for a single company, with people treating the entire office like a water cooler. But in our experience, it tends to work really well with small teams cohabitating in a larger space. We've found that the random collisions that occur among disparate companies and diverse individuals are worth the "loss of productivity." And we think that being human in a workspace with other humans has intrinsic value. Full stop.

Just to be clear, we are not advocating for a virtual accelerator. We firmly believe in a shared space for your accelerator program. We see it as an intrinsic part of the experience of being in an accelerator — and a critical component of the community you are working to enhance.

# tl;dr You're not building a coworking space. You're building an accelerator space.

Yes, people will cowork out of your accelerator space. But your accelerator space is not a coworking space. This is an important distinction, so let's unpack that a bit.

### Coworking is comfortable

We've noticed a tendency in the accelerator industry to deck out your shared workspace with the latest and greatest. Swanky furniture. Gaming equipment. Tons of outlets. Sit/stand desks. Comfy office chairs. Bean bags. Ping pong tables. Catered kitchens…

Honestly, we could go on and on.

Yes, people ooh and ah when they see the space. And yes, if you're running a coworking space, the aesthetic makes it easier to defend the prices you're charging them for space. And yes, it can provide a certain sense of pride for the folks running the space. 

There is a certain je ne sais quoi to a cohesive interior design aesthetic. 

It's an aesthetic that's required for coworking. Because you need people — people who could otherwise roll out of bed and start working — to feel the motivation to commute into an office space. You need people to feel that there is intrinsic value in the space you're providing. And you need people to be comfortable with the prices they are paying in return for that investment. 

But, to be honest, more often than not, those are false positives. They don't really make for a great community space. Or accelerator space. That design element makes for a great coworking space. 

Over designing is a mistake.  

Don't feel guilty. PIE fell for this trap too. It happens. But this is about you making new mistakes, remember? Not repeating ours. 

At the PIE space, our initial build out was the equivalent of set design for the quintessential startup workspace. Complete with painted and distressed closet doors as desktops supported by heavily welded — and rustically beautiful — sawhorses.  

But for as compelling as the design was, it simply didn't work.

Why? Well, what we've learned over the years is that the space must be viable and functional. Aside from that, it should never be comfortable. It should never be easy. The space should be just difficult enough. Without being frustrating. 

# tl;dr We encourage you to think of the collaborative workspace in terms of being "utilitarian." It should be awkward at best. Leaning toward uncomfortable.

It's not that we didn't have the ability to make the space more comfortable. It's simply that it *shouldn't* be comfortable. That is not the purpose of the space. The space, like building a startup, should be difficult. And awkward. It should always cause friction. And discomfort.

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
> Antoine de Saint-Exupery. 

Your only requirements are a solid wifi connection, access to power, a surface for a laptop, and a chair. That's it. Beyond that, you provide less than is needed. 

Think less office space, more coffeeshop or bar.

You should have too many people in the space. It should be noisy. You should have too few conference rooms. People should be eavesdropping whether they want to or not. You should have passible coffee and, if it fits your culture, beer. And most of all, everyone should be in one another's way.

![There are no forks](/source/images/2015-03-13-13.55.06.jpg)

Why put the startups through additional stress and turmoil? Because your objective is not to coddle startups. If you want to coddle them, then start an incubator. Protect them with warmth and comfort. Shield them from the outside world. Create a utopian existence for them. That's what an incubator should do.

Your job as an accelerator, however, is to get them moving further faster than they would on their own. Your job is to get them to grow up and out. Your job is to create a microcosm. A biome of startup life. They same way it exists in the real world. But with a few safety nets strewn here and there.

And then you need to poke the startups so that, from time to time, they tumble into those safety nets.

If you provide a space that is too comfortable and too accommodating then the startups will stay there. Forever. And that isn't what you want. You want churn. You want growth. You want backfill. And activity. And hustle.

Yes, they're often amazing people to be around. But you need to get them out of the space. And you need to encourage them to move out. And they need to want to do that. That needs to be a motivating factor. An unspoken rule. 

> We are inviting you into our space because we want you to leave.  

Like being embarrassed to bring your friends over to your parents house because their idea of decor is decades out of date. Your accelerator is — both literally and figuratively — their parents' basement. And it should be just as awkward as that arrangement.

There are also fringe benefits to this sort of interior design. You, as an accelerator staff remain scrappy. You feel less comfortable. You don't have it easy, either. And that's just how it should be.

![PIE's kitchen "table"](/source/images/pie-kitchen-table.jpg)

Potential investors walking into the space shouldn't see opulence. They should see a situation that they want to help your startups escape. The space should inspire the thought that "We need to get you out of here."  

## IKEA is your friend

Don't make furnishings a major line item. We used low cost dining room tables from IKEA. And even though we bought them in 2011, they're still holding their own today. And look practically brand new. (Provide product details)

Want a standing desk? Combine that kitchen table with a coffee table to make a fairly ergonomic standing desk for most folks.

# Recipe for an Accelerator

## Establish a thesis

Even if you're not planning to invest capital in your Startups, you should still do one thing like an investor: have a thesis. 

What's a thesis? It's something that guides the types of companies with whom you want to work and often — more importantly — a guideline that prevents you from working with companies that aren't the right fit for your Accelerator.

A thesis is especially important for a first-time program. Otherwise, you'll try to take all comers, which will set you up for failure on any number of fronts.

# tl;dr A thesis will help guide all of your Accelerator activities

You don't have to be married to your thesis forever and it can change as often as you want. But you need one. Your thesis can be defined by market dynamics, community trends, the expertise of your mentors, the success of your startups, the desires of your patron, or any combination thereof. It just needs to be defined. And you need to stick to it.

At PIE, we hit upon the fact that we were really good at accelerating technology platforms and enabling technology. Or to put it another way, we did really well with developers building tools for other developers. Why did we get good at this? There were any number of reasons but among the most important were:

- Portland has a long history of building platforms and enabling technologies, so there were more folks who had "been there and done that" with these types of businesses.
- Our mentors had expertise in building platforms.
- Our alums happened to be focused on platforms.
- The risk tolerance profile for the Portland community favored platforms and enabling technologies over consumer plays because the perceived risks and challenges are lesser.
- As mentors and alums helped us recruit companies, they inevitably drew from a community of peers — many of whom were building platforms or enabling technology
- Being founded in collaboration with a creative agency, We inherited some of the culture of the agency — a company built on the premise of helping other companies.
- We started PIE just as both the SaaS and mobile markets were exploding

## Know where you suck

Know — don’t assume; know — what you are truly good at doing.

And even more importantly? Be willing to admit where you suck.

At PIE, it quickly became obvious that we sucked at helping startups with fundraising. We were hamstrung by several things.

First, there was a nascent investment community in Portland. 

Second, the community that happened to exist did not possess a complementary risk profile for the companies with whom we were working. Because of that, the local investors had little appetite for the types of companies as investments. 

Third, we had not established adequate ties with investors in other regions. We had friends here and there, but we didn’t have a strong rolodex of investors whose theses matched our startup profiles.

But you know what? Admitting we sucked at that — and being open with our applicants that we sucked at that — freed us up to be better at any number of other things. And made us way better and more focused on the things we were good at doing. Not only that, but it provided us with yet another measure by which to select the companies we chose.

## But also know what your strengths are

PIE mentor and Techstars Seattle Managing Director, Chris DeVore, provides a [compelling list of the things that Seattle is good at doing](http://crashdev.com/2017/01/what-is-seattle-best-at/). 

While your list might not be as long as Chris' — Seattle has been at this for a while — it's important that you take the time to assess what strengths your staff, mentors, startups, and regional expertise bring to the mix. 

If you've been part of your startup community for a significant amount of time, you may be able to rattle off these strengths, anecdotally. If not, you should return to your findings from your environmental scan to help you identify strengths that will benefit your accelerator and community.

## Onboarding 

With the growing prevalence of Accelerators and the popularity of programs like Y Combinator, Techstars, and 500 startups, it has become common to assume that people are cognizant, if not deeply knowledgeable, about Accelerators, what they are designed to do, how they operate, and how to make the most of being a participant in one.

Nothing could be further from the truth. 

In fact, one of the biggest mistakes most accelerators make — and we've made it a few times — is with onboarding. Or, to put it another way, assuming that participants realize what the accelerator is designed to do, what resources are available, and how to make best use of those resources.

If you're building an early stage tech accelerator, you can sometimes skate by without doing a great deal of onboarding. And just get lucky. We wouldn't recommend it, but you could do that.

Why? Because most early stage tech companies are familiar with the concept of accelerators. They know what they are designed to do. And they understand, at a high level, what they're supposed to get out of the accelerator.

Other industries? Not so much. The accelerator is not a common concept. So  we've found that assuming folks will know how to engage is a huge mistake. You have to tell them.

Tech founder or not, fact of the matter is that most Founders — regardless of their familiarity with Accelerator model — have a limited understanding of how an Accelerator works, how to make use with the resources being offered, or how to effectively engage with the firehose of connections to which they're being exposed.

Granted, learning to deal with these issues is part of the educational process of being in the Accelerator. But part of it is just an unnecessary waste of Founders' and Mentors' time and Accelerators' resources. So give your startups the best chance of succeeding by preparing them with some Accelerator 101 onboarding. 


# Give the startups context

It’s important to recognize that joining an Accelerator program — despite the potential upside for the company in the long run — is a huge, immediate disruption for the Founders. And the transition from a typical startup day-to-day of "building a company at your own pace" and "being in charge of your own schedule" into the Accelerator environment can be jarring, at best. And going from working out of a coffee shop or a kitchen to a structured accelerator program is a big transition.

Some individuals may have relocated to participate in your program. Entire companies may have pulled up and moved to your town. Even people who call your town home may soon be spending time in a part of town that's unfamiliar. Or that they're not used to visiting, day in and day out.   

So we recommend that you do what you can to help mitigate this feeling of displacement by making them feel at home. 

Some suggested welcome wagon items that you can provide ahead of time may include:
 
- Housing suggestions, referrals, or Airbnb listings
- Maps of the city
- Information on public transportation
- Places to buy groceries and shop
- Available on-demand services like Instacart, Postmates, and Lyft
- Restaurants
- Coffeeshops
- Bars

Again, those are just a few examples. We just encourage Accelerator staff to put themselves in the Founders' shoes. What would you want to know if you were moving to a new city or a new office? What kind of information would you find valuable about your town or the Accelerator's neighborhood. Start there. Because your startups will want to know that too.

We recommend providing documentation and creating some sort of reference for startups so they know what to expect as the program becomes more structured. It’ll also help them be clear on deadlines for deliverables and the expectations for them.

Here are some examples of letters we’ve used:

- [What you’re getting yourself in to](/notes/logistics/onboarding-what-youre-getting-in-to.md) 
- [Woohoo! Here’s what to expect on your first day](/notes/logistics/onboarding-what-to-expect.md). (Along with acceptance letter)

Consider providing these docs along with a welcome basket of swag.  Again, it’s about making folks feel welcome. The more comfortable your startups feel in the space, the sooner they’ll be feel the motivation to work — and begin building up the trust that will enable them to succeed in this environment.

## Day 0

## Day 1

## Take it slow

We’ve found that too much scheduling the first few days can lead to a bumpy kickoff for companies starting the program. The first day of your program should be dedicated to introducing teams to one another, giving an office tour, letting people get settled and then finally, letting them get to work.

# Family Dinner

Arguably one of the most important parts of the program, family dinner is a weekly gathering exclusively for our company founders to come together, share status updates and gives guidance to one another over dinner. We’ve found that only talking about each other’s successes tends to discourage any folks who are further behind or have had a rough week, so we keep family dinner conversations strictly to topics where founders could use help and support.  Think of it as it a support group over dinner.

Having a gathering like this is crucial to the (mental) health of your program and founders and will deepen the connections between companies.  Peer mentoring is not something that can be forced, but in a setting like family dinner, it is only natural that folks will offer help to their fellow founders.
 
Here are a few tips for how to effectively run a family dinner – because it’s not just as simple as ordering food.
 
For a program of 6-8 companies, dinner usually run for an hour and a half.  Any longer than that and folks will start tuning out, and trust us, it will go longer than that if you’re not in control.  To avoid dinners that drag on, help your founders either cut to the chase, by calling out specific issues you know they’re having and could use help on or know when to politely cut folks off and move to the next company.  You don’t want to discourage any dialog that happens, but you do want to be mindful of everyone’s times.  Suggest they continue the conversation post dinner.
 
As a management team, it is your responsibility to know what buttons to push and what levers to pull, to get your founders to open up. Group sharing might not come naturally at first, so it is important to create a safe space to facilitate sharing. Adopt the “what you hear at family dinner, stays at family dinner” motto or a Friend-DA. 
 
These dinners are always open to founders who are alums of the PIE program, and if you’re running your dinners right, your alumni will be regulars.
 
We recommend hosting your dinners on-site rather than at a restaurant, unless you can get a private room. Having the meal catered means it’s easier for folks to get up from their desk and join, rather than being tempted to go home and stay there before joining you at restaurant.
 
Unless teams are traveling, consider family dinner mandatory.

## Family Dinner 0.9 Beta (Coworking version)

The original PIE Family Dinner had very little to do with dinner. It was held on a weekly basis — usually a Thursday around 4:00PM — and consisted of a group of folks grabbing a beer and sitting around chatting about what they were experiencing. We only called it Family Dinner because that's what YC called their gathering. And we liked the implications of family and strengthening the connections among the members of the PIE folks.

As far as participants, it tended to be a mixture of folks from early stage startups and other individual contributors working out of the space.  There were a few regular attendees. But the mix changed and morphed from week to week. Conversations ranged from business to personal life to business' impact on personal life.

Then something interesting began to happen. Rather than simply sitting around and engaging in small talk, folks began to share issues and problems they were having. They began to explore the stress and emotions of running a startup. And they began to shed the "entrepreneurial veneer" of "Everything is awesome!" to reveal what was really happening. And to start to ask for help.

## Family Dinner 1.0 (Coworking version)

As Family Dinner moved from Happy Hour to Reality Hour, something interesting began to happen. More folks attended. More folks participated. More folks shared. And more folks were encouraged to share. 
  
> Rather than opting for voluntary participation, the weekly event became an exercise in peer mentoring. 

Each person who arrived was required to talk about what they were going through that week. In turn, other folks around the table were required to comment, critique, and collaborate to help that individual. Family Dinner began to solve problems — or identify problems as intractable. 

Family Dinner problems began to take three distinct forms:

1. **Been there done that.** An individual would highlight a problem that they had experienced. That problem had already been solved by someone else around the table. The two parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue. 
2. **Now, that's interesting.** An individual would raise an issue that no one had ever dealt with previously, and yet folks were motivated to solve collaboratively. Multiple parties would collaborate to accelerate the resolution of the issue.
3. **Stop. Do not pass Go.** An individual would raise an issue that folks had tried to solve before, but it would be defined to be a completely intractable problems with no solution. Rather than continue to struggle, the individual would be encouraged to move on — or move around — that problem.

But it wasn't without its flaws. Some folks begin commanding more airtime than others. So we put a time limit on it. And enforced a requirement for everyone to talk. We tried to create a culture of collaboration. Where everyone was getting value out of the gathering. Not just a few squeaky wheels.

# Creating a cadence

One of the most critical efforts for the accelerator staff is that of managing the cadence of the class. Both in terms of introducing stressors and pulling pressure-release valves, as necessary. 

There is no prescribed timing here. You add more pressure when it is needed. And you try to break the tension when needed. There is no schedule here. You just have to play it by ear. And act with your best instincts.

That said, there are some clear guardrails to help guide your efforts.

# Three months

PIE chose to run our program for a three month intensive period. 

We ran the first class for four and half months, and it seemed to be too long. So we shortened the program. Later, we'll get into why it seemed long. 

## Three months is a very short time

Most corporations, governments, and larger organization often question how we can possibly get anything effective done in three months. "Three months seems so short," they say. 

And it is. It's a short intensive period of incredibly stressful work. Piled on top of — or in the middle of — the long period of incredibly stressful and arduous work that is building a startup. (In all honesty, the accelerator period is the least stressful — and most supportive — of any of it.)

And if companies aren't careful, the three months can slip by very quickly. Too quickly. Without much to show for it. A few skipped mentor meetings. A talk or two. And suddenly it's Demo Day. Just like that. 

## Three months is a very long time

But fact of the matter is, when you're in the thick of it, three months is an incredibly long time. Especially when you're breaking it into minutes. 

![PIE's infamous countdown clock](/source/images/pie-countdown-clock.jpg)

From the time the first day of PIE starts until we bring the house lights down and Demo Day begins is about 130,000 minutes. And each one is critical. 

But no matter how motivated the founder, no matter how real the opportunity, no matter how passionate the team, it's a challenge to keep the momentum going. It's nearly impossible, over that length of time, to keep a sustained sprint going. It's like running toward a goal somewhere off in the distance. Like trying to realize a strategy without any tactics. 

So even those three seemingly short months have to be broken down into smaller chunks. To manage the cadence of the class. To manage the stress. To ensure — and endure — momentum. And perhaps, most importantly, to give the startups a sense of progress over the course of the class. 

By class three (Coconut Creme), we had learned to break the class into three marathons, each about a month a piece. A series of stages and gates that culminated in the performance at Demo Day. 

Throughout the course of these stages and gates, we tailor the mentor talks to match the topic — or to queue up the obvious need for the startups to focus on these particular topics.

Here's how we broke it out. We refer to it as "the three Ps": product, projections, and pitch. 

### Product (Month 1)

Because PIE classes generally consisted of groups of developers who understood how to build products, we started in a place of strength and confidence: product development. 

The challenge? Be ready to demo the current version of the company's product in front of the others startups in the class. The deadline was one month into the class. And it was a required activity. 

For some, this was a relatively simple request and in line with their product development schedules. For others, it required a great deal of effort to meet the milestone.

But that led to some interesting things, as well.

Those who were further ahead on product often discovered that they lacked the language to effectively convey what they were building. Worse yet, they sometimes that the current version of the product was difficult, if not impossible, to demo to a diverse audience. 

We get to question assumptions, clarify utility, and make suggestions, as a class — in a group environment. Companies get to respond directly to queries, jot down feature ideas, and generally scratch their head a great deal and ask "Why **did** we do it that way?"

So month one, get the product momentum going. And reward those who are making progress. Because that's going to be the crux of everything going forward. 

It's a safe place to start. Because we choose companies that have a solid developer or development team. And its gives both the developer and business cofounders the chance to show off what they're doing to a trusted group of peers. (After one month of accelerator stress, those bonds have already formed.)  

### Projections (Month 2)

Product development, of course, continues throughout the course of the class — and for the life of the company. But we reduce the focus on that activity in month one. Giving the CTO/developer breathing room to resolve issues raised during the first month and work through the issues list as they prepare to release beta. 

Now that we've stressed out the developers, we put the stress on the business people. Who, more often than not, are developers learning how to business. 

And in our experience, nothing makes a business person feel more businessy than creating a spreadsheet with lots of dollar values in it. So that's exactly what we focus on during month two, projections.

We usually choose a 12 month window, because none of us know what's really going to happen in the future. But a year seems like a viable window to explore these numbers.

With projections, we experience the polar opposite of product. No one feels confident in their numbers. Most companies don't even know where to begin. 

To support, we offer templates, mentors, and office hours to help. But it usually doesn't. And it becomes a last minute scramble, rife with cries of "Do we really have to do this?"

The answer is "Yes." It's a required element of the class.

From this position of lacking confidence, the revealing of the projections to peers in the a group becomes a very different exercise. With the presenting founder often asking more questions than the audience.

"How did you do this?", "Does this seem realistic?", "What's missing?"

A second month of stress induced collaboration has heightened the trust among peers from a feeling of camaraderie to a dynamic of peer mentorship. And this is exactly what we're trying to engender. 

But this is generally a crushing demonstration, leaving the founders feeling exposed and confused. But it's a critical part of figuring out their business. And the strengthening of the class relationship, alone, is worth the friction.  

### Pitch (Month 3)

Both product and projection development continue in month three. But now that we've established the context of what the team is building and what they need to do to succeed financially, we have established the focus of their pitch and the presentation they will be delivering at Demo Day. 

It's important to note that many programs choose to pitch throughout the course of the entire class. We've found this to have diminishing returns if run for longer than a month. It's also a good chunk of time which we feel is better focused on things like product and projections.

If the product demo is the area of the most confidence and projections are the area of least confidence, the pitch is somewhere in the middle. But it's often the most difficult to refine and finesse, so plan to spend a great deal of time doing it. 

At PIE, we played it by ear, with no fewer than two full group pitch practices per week. With individual staff, mentor, and peer-to-peer pitch practices rounding out the month of activity. 

We began with no slides, only story. Because it does no good to waste time building slides for a story that is going to change drastically anyway. We continue with no slides until we feel the stories are starting to solidify. Then we move to pitches with slides and story.

Group pitch practices are attended by all startups and staff. Mentors are invited to attend when and if they can. Presenters receive feedback from staff, peers, and their team members. 

But there is one distinct difference from the previous two milestones. The difference — and this is critically important — is that while previous presentations are a conversation among the presenter and the audience, this feedback loop is one way. The audience can critique the presentation, but the presenter cannot respond. 

Why? Well, we learned from our speaking coach mentor that this is a critical step in getting people to actually implement changes and improve their talks. You see, if they respond to the feedback, they subconsciously assume that they've fixed the problem. So don't let them respond. And they go and actually fix the problem.

Once the story and deck are starting to come together, start recording the presenters. Not only will it give them a valuable asset to review, it will present another stressor that breaks them out of their comfort zone.

Another piece of feedback we've received from the startups? 

The last week is pretty much nonstop practice, where we not only continue to finesse the story and the deck, but we start getting the presenter to give the pitch in the uniform that they plan to wear on stage. We've learned that the more we gradually attempt to mimic the environment and conditions they will experience on Demo Day — even if it can't be done perfectly — the better the presentations are.

If you can, take the opportunity to have the presenters practice in the venue. We've had difficulty doing this because of competing auditorium schedules. So for us, it's rare for startups to get the chance to practice on stage prior to day-of. We compensate two ways: We use the W+K auditorium space to practice and we get to the venue early on Demo Dy and do a few dry runs before the audience arrives. 

## The emotional ebb and flow of a stressful startup accelerator 

We've all heard it. "Going through an accelerator is an emotional roller coaster." And we'd be the first to agree. It's not an easy or smooth experience. For anyone.

But what, exactly, does that roller coaster look like?

At PIE, we've spent time analyzing the behavior of founders in both our accelerator as well as other programs in which we've had the opportunity to participate. And that analysis has led to a rough sketch of the general ebb and flow of emotions that founders experience throughout the course of an accelerator program.

Now, granted, this is a sweeping generalization that may not apply to every founder in a program. But we've found that paying attention to this emotional cycle — and managing the program accordingly — can be beneficial for founders, their partners, families, mentors, and the accelerator staff. 

# tl;dr Understanding the emotional roller coaster tells you when it's reasonable to increase the stress — and when you'd be wise to pull the pressure valve. 

So with that caveat in mind, let's walk through the emotional roller coaster that is an accelerator. (Note: We've noticed a similar cadence with folks who chase and receive venture capital, as well, for what it's worth.)

![Startup Emotional Roller Coaster](/source/images/pieAcceleratorEmotionalRollerCoaster.001.png)

Right? That's a lot to take in. Let's break it into sections so that we can deal with all of this mayhem you're putting your founders through.

### Pre-Accelerator

It's highly likely that your startups have had some existence prior to their experience with your accelerator. During that time, they've had a series of highs and lows where they've experienced any number of leaps forward and, likely, an equal number of setbacks. I mean, that's why they're looking for some help, right?

We're not going to claim that we can predict every up and down, but let's take a look at some of the key moments in the experience, prior to joining your Accelerator program.

![Startup pre-Accelerator Detail](/source/images/pieAcceleratorEmotionalRollerCoasterPreAccelerator-Detail.png)

1. **False Ceiling of Euphoria** We've learned that the Accelerator environment accelerates, among other things, emotions. As such, we've learned that the highs are far higher than they have seemed to the founders in the past. For that reason, we categorize the pinnacle of euphoria for founders prior to the accelerator as a "false ceiling." Accelerator staff and mentors need to be prepared to help accentuate the good times — and to help regulate euphoric misconceptions.
2. **False Floor of Despair** If the "highs are higher," then guess what? That's right. The lows are way lower. Within the accelerator environment, we often find founders struggling with depression and negativity that surmounts anything with which they had to deal prior to entering the accelerator program. Accelerator staff and mentors need to be prepared for how paralyzingly acute these lows can be.
3. **"I found the perfect Accelerator for us!"** When startups are looking for support, finding an Accelerator that best matches their needs can be a high point for them. It's important that Accelerator staff understand and appreciate this moment of euphoria and do their best to cultivate a relationship with each and every Founder who has an interest in their Accelerator.
4. **"It's been 30 seconds and they haven't responded. They hate us."** Just as quickly as Founders get excited about your Accelerator, they'll get equally despondent if you don't respond to them immediately. Make sure that you're adequately staffed to deal with the influx of questions and inquiries. Automate as much as you can to ensure that Founders always get a response to every request. For example, make sure that there is some indication that a submitted application has been received and is being reviewed. Otherwise, you'll get multiple questions from each and every Founder.
5. **"We made it through the entire process and they accepted us!"** Once accepted to a program, Founders often experience a sense of euphoria coupled with relief. To many Founders, the recognition and acceptance create a false sense of accomplishment. When in reality, it is actually the starting line for a much more difficult — and emotionally taxing — phase for their company.
6. **"Maybe we've made a mistake. Is this the right move for us?"** While the period of euphoria may last for some, most Founders will experience a return to a more calm outlook prior to their beginning the program. This may also manifest itself as having second thoughts or cold feet about joining the Accelerator program at all. Be prepared for questions and Founders seeking reassurance.

### Month 1 

Now that the company has been accepted to the program and is starting the accelerator process, they'll go through some severe swings of emotions. 

As we mentioned above, PIE generally worked with founders who were confident with building product. Your founders may be similar. Or you may attract founders with different points of confidence. 

Whatever the case, it is important that you begin the accelerator program focusing on the area or topic where your founders boast the most confidence. The accelerator environment can be exceedingly stressful and emotionally taxing. By starting your founders in an area of strength, you give them the best chance of surviving the emotional onslaught of their new reality.

![Startup Accelerator Month 1](/source/images/pieAcceleratorEmotionalRollerCoasterMonth01Detail.png)

1. **"Acceptance! We've made it! The sky is the limit."** Once the Founders accept that the Accelerator is the right thing for their startup and cofounders, there is a palpable upswing in emotion. But it is important to note that there will be first date jitters and nerves. Each Founder deals with it differently, but it tends to be an incredibly positive and reassuring time for most companies. The nerves are perceived as excitement rather than dread. And the notion that someone not only believes in the Founders and their idea but is willing to help them succeed is an incredibly heady feeling for most.
2. **"We are killing it!" aka Breaking through the false ceiling of euphoria** What happens when you get a bunch of euphoric and excited Founders together? That's right: mass hysteria. As Founders' emotions play off of one another, individual Founders find that heady feeling growing at an exponential rate. What previously seemed like the height of happiness — the False Ceiling of Euphoria — pales in comparison to the feeling of giddiness most of the Founders begin to experience. But as the Founders begin to realize their new existence in the Accelerator program, this feeling of euphoria begins to ebb. *Note: This will likely be the last time Founders feel emotionally positive for months.*
3. **"We're doing it wrong." aka Crashing through the false floor of despair**  The stress and strain of the new environment, the seemingly relentless strings of new tasks and expectations, Mentor whiplash, and a feeling of being unable to navigate — let alone manage — the Accelerator environment can be emotionally crushing. This would be bad enough, alone. But it's exacerbated by the fact that the Founders are coming down off of the highest peak of euphoria. We often see Founders barreling down from this crest at breakneck speed, culminating in a descent into the lowest of lows. Lower, in fact, than any of the worst days prior to entering the Accelerator program. It's a true bottoming out. Previous failures and bad days pale in comparison to the Founder's current emotional state. They feel like complete failures and become very inwardly focused, detaching from their peers and cofounders and grasping to find something that they feel capable of handling. 
4. **"Everybody else seems to be struggling with the same issues."** Once the startups get settled, the founders get comfortable with one another, and folks begin to settle into a daily rhythm, participants will stop being so inwardly focused — and will begin refrain from continually beating themselves up. They'll start to notice the struggles of their peers. They'll begin conversations about how they're struggling. And they'll discover that they're not alone. This causes a slight improvement in attitude. Not stellar, but an upswing.   
5. **"We're still the worst company in here."** But that upswing is short lived as founders rapidly return to self criticism. This is usually based on their misperception that every other founder in the program is handling the stress and scheduling more effective. Or is making better use of the resources at his/her disposal. While this viewpoint is often ill founded — no one is actually doing terribly well at this point — it can still cause a dip founders' emotional states. It's especially important to note that this mindset can be reinforced by other founders celebrating wins. So it's important to keep both the positive and negative stuff in check. 
6. **"Product demo went okay. And folks here seem to get what we do."** With the first month being wholly focused on product — and the bulk of PIE founders being product-centric founders — the opportunity to demo is an uplifting one. While founders rarely have a cohesive story about their product at this point, other founders can intuit motivations and functions, giving the companies a sense of belonging. This reinforces the feeling that the product has merit. And it helps reinforce the founders' feeling of belonging in the accelerator program. 

### Month 2 

This is by far the worst month for most startups in an Accelerator program. The winter of our discontent? A staggering understatement. You'll find companies remaining well below the midline for this entire month. It's rare to see them even begin to approach it. 

And there's really no way to fix this or prevent this. If you've done your job correctly as an accelerator, you've put your founders under so much pressure in the first month — and so much has changed about their business — that your founders will be feeling pretty beat up. And they'll feel like they're bumping along the bottom of the tank of despair. The false floor of despair is long forgotten. 

Some of your founders will have higher amplitude in their spikes and troughs. Others will simply bump along throughout the month. 

![Startup Accelerator Month 2](/source/images/pieAcceleratorEmotionalRollerCoasterMonth02Detail.png)

1. **"I thought we were getting it, but we're not."** Coming off the product demo, founders may be able to retain some semblance of euphoria. But it's far more likely that this "accomplishment" will quickly erode into stress about all of the other thing that the startup has to accomplish during the accelerator. This is the classic point where founders feel completely overwhelmed. Emotions and egos are extremely fragile at this point in time. And burn out is a significant risk. 
2. **"We can do this."** If anything, founders are resilient. And stubborn. And they'll figure out ways to rebound. Even in short bursts. No matter what you throw at them. This difficult time is often the most rewarding and reinforcing of the accelerator. Confidence is built. Egos are rebuilt. And founders start to feel like they're actually starting to get a handle on this new existence. They're not overly confident. But their confidence is building. As is their understanding of how to manage themselves, their companies, and their peer relationships, both within the company and within the cohort. That's what make this the perfect point to teach — and challenge — the founders on their greatest weaknesses. Because they've developed the resilience to handle it. 
3. **"We don't seem any worse off than anyone else."** Not only does confidence build, but Month 2 is the month where founders gain the most empathy for their cofounders and peers. They start to recognize that everyone is struggling. And that even the most confident and capable founders in the cohort have their weaknesses. So when you introduce subject matter with which everyone struggles — and everyone recognizes that one another is struggling — you enforce a tendency toward collaboration, support, and peer mentorship. Which, in turn, fortifies the connections and feeling of community among the participants. 

### Month 3 

This will be the most rewarding month for your startups. Not only will they make significant progress, they will make tangible progress that will directly impact the future of their companies. 

![Startup Accelerator Month 3](/source/images/pieAcceleratorEmotionalRollerCoasterMonth03Detail.png)

1. **"After talking to folks, I'm not sure our company is viable."**
2. **"We get to pitch! We totally get pitching."**
3. **"No one got our pitch. We're not even going to make it to the stage."**
4. **"Wait a second. This is working."**
5. **Demo Day: "This is the best day of my life."**



## Typical week in PIE

We often get asked, "What's a typical week like in your accelerator?" And while the term "typical week" is an oxymoron for PIE, there are some things that occur with enough regularity — and provide enough structure for participants — that we can describe them.

So here's an imperfect look at a typical week at PIE:

## Monday

**8:00AM** 
Staff arrives and meets with one another about the week's upcoming events. Some startups are already working.

**10:00AM** 
Workspace is full. All startups have arrived. Staff holds one-on-one meetings with each team. 

**5:00PM**
Family Dinner starts. Founders and staff leave the workspace to have dinner together. Non-founding team members remain in the space working. 

**7:00PM** 
Family Dinner ends. Startups return to workspace and continue working. Staff returns to space. Compares notes. Continues peer mentoring momentum from Family Dinner.

**8:00PM** 
Workspace is about half full with the founders who prefer the late shift. Staff remains online in the chat room or accessible via email.

## Tuesday

**8:00AM** 
Staff arrives. Continues making mentor connections for startups based on issues raised during family dinner. *Note: It may take as many as two or three mentors with subject matter expertise to help each startup resolve each issue. Your job, from a staff perspective, is to help make this process as efficient as possible.*  

> Make things as simple as possible but no simpler.
> Albert Einstein

**10:00AM**

				98. Curriculum
					105. More independent study than classroom
						106. Founders are extremely creative and driven, but they  are also intently focused on the immediate problem at hand. To them, nothing else matters but the problem they are working on right now today. Which, of course, tends to differ from startup to startup. And while those startups may _eventually_ all experience the same problem, they will not intuit that the problem exists until they encounter it. Therefore, it is our opinion that it is  nearly impossible to teach at scale in a classroom environment on an ongoing basis.

**Advice for startups: Working with mentors**

Are you interested in engaging with mentors? Good. That's what we're here to do.

Here are a some tips:

## OVERALL
- These folks are volunteering their time because they want to give back to the community. Please be cognizant and respectful of this contribution.
- Please understand that while our program is a priority for them, they have day jobs and families and whatnot.
- Following the deep dive meetings, management has compiled a list of mentors who will be helpful to your startup. We will make those introductions on an ongoing basis. Please use one of the two methods below for engaging with those mentors.
- If you’re not finding mentors who meet your needs, please alert management with your concerns and we will recruit mentors to assist with your particular situation.
- Shit happens. Sometimes they’ll need to cancel and/or reschedule.

## OFFICE HOURS
- Keep tabs on the Office Hours page and be on the lookout for mentors who you find interesting 
- If management staff sees a mentor with office hours who would be beneficial for you, we’ll generally nudge you to set up some time.
- Once you’ve secured time, confirm the time and place via email. Mentors are busy and sometimes a single email gets lost in the fray.
- Do one last follow up/confirmation via email evening before/morning of your meeting.
- Following the Office Hours, send a follow up email touching on any salient points.
- Fill out the mentor feedback form

## AD HOC MENTOR MEETINGS

Need an intro?

The database was designed to be an easy way of searching through the mentor network. Feel free to search through and find folks who are of interest to you.

Ping management with requests for introduction or schedule time via mentor’s office hours

Once you’re introduced…

- Once management makes an email introduction, immediately follow up to schedule a time and place with the mentor.
- Do one last follow up/confirmation via email evening before/morning of your meeting.
- Following the Office Hours, send a follow up email touching on any salient points.
- Fill out the mentor feedback form

					
				99. Mentor engagement
					100. Formal
						101. Presentation with Q&A
							102. As we mention above, founders only care about the problem they’re experiencing today, right now. To further the disconnect, even if a mentor provides step-by-step instructions with excruciating details, the founder will never be able to recreate the steps, moments in time, or luck that founder had. 
							103. For this reason, we suggest that mentor presentations primarily be used as an anecdotal learning experience. Not a teaching one.
							104. Your primary objective with this format is to convince your founders that they, like the mentor, are capable of succeeding. 
							104. Mentors, therefore, should avoid chest thumping. They should be comfortable sharing stories of failure, mistakes, and missteps. Things the mentors wish they had done differently. Stories about how they got lucky. And things they wish they had known during their journey. 
							105. This allows the founders to extract the content that is important and relevant to their current frame of mind and ask clarifying questions as needed.
						100. Workshops

**Lunch and Learns** 

Sometimes a mentor talk, other times a workshop, lunch and learns are scheduled twice a week during the three month program during the lunch hour. Speakers can range from founders with anecdotal “war stories” to subject matter experts. We often bring our higher profiled mentors in for these talks, as it is easier to schedule for them. These are some of the most valuable learning opportunities of the program.
 
Despite how straightforward these sessions sound, we’ve discovered a few snags. There is a chance that any given topic, might not be something a company is dealing with that particular day or week, but trust us, they will – and when they are dealing with it, they might not have a chance to meet with that mentor again. This is one of those; take advantage of the opportunity while you have it, moments.
 
Teams will be busy and claim they just don’t have the time for another meeting.  Again, see above. These opportunities aren’t always on the table so they should be treated as such. 
 
Active engagement is crucial for the companies and for the speakers.  A silent room means that your companies aren’t paying attention or asking questions and maybe even more importantly, it means that your speaker is wasting their time and becoming less and less likely to mentor for your program again. We ask our companies to step away from their machines and actively listen / take notes when during the session – it’s only an hour.
 
Oh, and don’t forget to supply lunch – as it’s in the name and presents an opportunity for peer mentoring among the companies or a chance to talk more with the speaker. We’ve found it's best served before the talk.

This doesn’t have to be mentor led. This can be peer led. Some of the most interesting lunch and learns are peer led.

Example topics:
- Getting the most out of an accelerator
- Pricing Model roundtable – multiple mentors
- The importance of documentation  	
- Minimum “Valuable” Product
- Founder Talks
- Business Development 101
- Presenting 101 
- PR 101

**Encouraging bonding among peers** 

This is an important part of our program and one that we feel is often overlooked by others.  We believe that we aren’t just graduating individual companies from our program, but collaborative groups who will improve and enhance our existing community. 

But this doesn't necessarily happen organically. It takes effort. And intent. That's why we've learned to put time into creating opportunities that enable those peer bonds to form, even on a short timescale. 

We've also learned that it’s important to use a range of bonding activities. A beer or cocktail is fine every once in a while, but it's important to break out of the startup stereotype. Plan activities that don’t just involve drinking. Heck, maybe even plan some activities that are healthy (gasp) or educational. 

The basic rule is: Be inclusive. And provide a range of options. Not every option will work for every participant. 

Below is a list of things we’ve done.
	
## Activity examples 

### Cooking class
With a name like PIE, it should come as little surprise that a number of our activities revolve around food. And when you have that much creative talent in one room, sometimes it's refreshing to give folks a different outlet for that creativity — especially one that doesn't involve banging on a keyboard. 

One activity that met both our food and creativity needs was a cooking class. For the first couple of years, we partnered with a local food accelerator that had commercial kitchen space. They put together a menu, taught our founders to prepare a dish from scratch, and then the entire group had the opportunity to share in the creations, family style. 

Everyone — no matter how well attuned they were to a kitchen — was out of his or her element. And it put everyone on equal footing. Best of all, there were always a few unexpected surprises when we discovered the true chefs in our midst.

Each year we did this resulted in the best family dinner of the class. 

### Alumni vs new class kickball or picnic 
### Away from the computer/office activities 
### Mixers + happy hours
we’ve done hot sauce tasting, cheese and wine pairings, etc

### Family open house
a lot of program companies have families.  It’s nice to give family and friends an opportunity to check out the space

Admittedly we could do a better job of fostering the community among all of our classes, but at the very least there is an understanding that they can count on one another for support.

# Demo Day 
## To Demo Day or not to Demo Day?
## Graduating from the program | DEMO DAY

Graduation requirements can be modified to fit your programs needs or specialities. Most, if not all, programs culminate with a demo day. Companies give a 6-8 minute pitches of their product in front of an audience that can be made up of a combination of stakeholders, investors, mentors, media, and/or community. 

We believe that the focus of demo day should be about gaining attention, not funding. Check don’t get written at demo days, but conversations get started. Your demo day can be as large or small, open or private, as makes sense for your program.  

But while all of the above is true, it is important to understand that demo days are regularly occurring events, meaning, you’re going to work very hard to get attention from the media and investors, and you still might not get it. Their dance cards are typically full. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have one, because it’s important to have something that signifies the culmination of the program.

You should also consider the demo day goals of your teams and come up with ways to help them reach them.  Can you get the investors or potential new client they're courting at demo day?  Help them set up a dinner afterwards, or drinks even. 

The hand holding doesn’t stop just because they’ve gone on stage.  

But on to the planning! Here is a look at how we handle ours, some suggestions, and some stats for context:

We believe it’s important to put just as much effort and energy into the event of demo day, as the companies put into their pitches. For many, this day signifies as their public launch and it is our responsibility to make their splash as big as it can be.  


## Objectives
## Audience
- Investors
- Media
- Community
- Mentors
- Government
- Peers
- Partners
- Sponsors

## Creativity

Demo Day is designed to showcase your companies, not just on stage, but in real world use. For that reason, we encourage you to consider creative ways to incorporate the presenting startups' products into the  Demo Day, itself. 

For example, we provided [PIE Demo Day 2014 content via Read The Docs](http://pie.readthedocs.io/) on the their Demo Day to showcase how useful and compelling their solution was. 

## Logistics

To help you stay on schedule, we're sharing this [PIE Demo Day: Run of Show document](/source/documents/pie-Demo-Day-Run-of-Show.xlsx).

### Invites
We manage our invites through Eventbrite and reserve groups of tickets for Investors, Media, Friends and Family, and Community. This enables us to control guest numbers within each group.  There is no cost to attend demo day, but you can make the invite password protected if that makes sense for your event.
 
### Venue
Ideally you'll find one that that not only meets your needs for capacity, but can also handle the technical requirements you’ll have.  Make sure that your venue gives you time for walk-thrus with the presenters as well as rehearsal time. Bonus if you find one where you can host your post presentation reception (we’ll talk about those in a bit).  We had our first at a locally owned theatre and served popcorn.  We’ve since held it at a nicer venue.  The details are important here.  It’s like the saying goes, dress for the job you want to have – find a venue that matches the level you’re aiming for.

As a reference we used the main theatre and mezzanine for our reception here: http://www.pcs.org/rent-the-armory/

### Technical requirements
#### Number one rule
Set your presenters and your audience up for success.  Having the right equipment will make your presenters and your program feel more polished.

#### Projector + Screen
Make sure that the projector and the screen are large enough that any one in the house can see.  Set your screen up in a place on stage so that presenters aren’t standing right in front of their presentations. 

#### Confidence monitors
**THESE ARE MANDATORY**, or at least should be.  While we expect our speakers to be prepared for anything during their presentations, ya know, technical glitches, power outages, booing (kidding), we like to provide them with a little bit of a security blanket.  1 for current screen, 1 for presenter notes.

#### Lav + hand mics
Presenters should use lav mics, period.  This is especially crucial if they’re going to be transitioning their own slides via a clicker.  Too many things to hold and they’ll find themselves juggling.  Hand mics should be reserved for anyone doing presenter introductions or show opening and closing notes.  

#### Wifi
A definite nice to have, but can get expensive if your venue isn’t equipped.  

Livestreaming: Another nice to have.  We reach another 1000+ viewers by having a live stream of our demo day.  This is great for folks who don’t have time to make a trip just for your event, but would still like to participate.

#### Entertainment/music: 
Most demo days have their companies walk on stage to a theme song.  We like to take that up a notch and have a live band perform the song.  The band stays on stage and adds a little extra flavor to the whole show.  Year after year, we get a ton of compliments on the band.  If you can swing it, you should.

### What to wear:
We have teams wear logo branded t-shirts, each team has a different color.  Why do we do this? Well because after 1.5-2 hour long presentations, folks tend to forget names and faces, but can recognize a t-shirt color / logo that they wanted to talk to.  Trust us.  It makes a difference.  How do you decide what colors folks wear? Well, you can let them fight to death, or you can decide for them.  Logos are either black or white - keep it simple.

### Demo day swag:
Sigh.  You could do it, but do you wanna?  (inside joke ftw) It’s really not worth the time or the money to create swag specific to your demo day.  We know because we’ve done it.  We’ve even created awesome notebooks with pages dedicated to each team so that while they present the user could take notes on that teams specific page AND it had their business card attached to the page! Pure genius and a total waste of money that no one used or cared about.  

### Post show reception (1.5 hours)
To facilitate conversations post presentations we host a private reception for our companies, media, and investors, immediately after curtain call.  Work with teams to find out who they’d like to attend and help make those introductions happen.  This is not a wrap party, but you should provide some bites and drinks. After all, the majority of the attendees just sat through an entire presentation. 

### Finally, food
Producing an event like demo day takes a lot of time.  Not only are you managing each individual company and making sure their presentation is ready, but you’re managing the entire show.  

### Denouement: Repair to dinner
One of the things we tried time and time again was to get the startups to take mentors and potential investors out to dinner after the event. From giving them money to do so to planning their itinerary. It never really worked as expected, but we still think it's a great way of continuing the conversations in a more intimate environment.

# Dessert 

## Post mortem

If you’ve done your work on pitch practice correctly, your startups will be primed to turn the tables on you. 

> “You critiqued my pitch? Let me critique your job.” 

At PIE, we even couch it as such. Like pitch practice, PIE staff may not respond to any criticism during the post mortem. We can take notes and ask for clarification on feedback. But we are not permitted to try to explain away any blemishes the startups describe. Nor are we allowed to defend our actions.

Not saying that all of the feedback is negative. Quite the opposite. But after the first thirty minutes or so, the founders start to run out of niceties. And then they get down to provide the truly valuable feedback.

We receive feedback over the course of an hour to ninety minutes from each startup, preferably with all members of the founding team. If necessary, we meet with founders separately and then consolidate the feedback.

Then we look for common themes and concerns. We place role-specific elements into buckets. Like if the CTOs all referenced a particular aspect of the program. Or if the majority of the CEOs had a similar complaint.

We're looking for things that we need to change to make the program more effective. Not easier. Not less stressful. But more effective.

To this end, we can almost guarantee that one of the most consistent pieces of feedback you will receive throughout the post mortem process is “I wish you would have told us [x] sooner” or “If only I’d be taught [x] earlier in the class.” 

Rest easy. Had you told them any earlier, they wouldn’t have heard you. They would have ignored it. Or they would have believed that the problem would never affect them.

Don’t believe us? Try telling your next class earlier and see what happens.

# Conclusion

One of the primary motivations for writing the PIE Cookbook was the firm belief that this programmatic model for assisting founders and companies could inform the development of additional accelerator models. Or entirely new ways of managing this sort of mentorship.

For that reason, we want you to take this guide as inspiration, rather than fact. Our motivation to share the PIE Cookbook isn’t to convince you to recreate PIE. It’s to inspire you to create something new — and better.

Because, let's be honest, no matter how much you love tech and innovation and all of the hype, the thought of starting some also-ran tech startup accelerator isn’t terribly interesting, these days.

# tl;dr It’s your job to improve upon the PIE recipe

With that in mind, please don’t try to recreate PIE. In fact, we would hate for you to bake our flavor of PIE. This isn’t a sleeve of prepared cookie dough that you halfheartedly slice onto a cookie sheet. This is a “Bake your own” proposition. This is a recipe. And everyone has their own unique ingredients.
This is about rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands in the mix. Making the recipe yours. Experimenting, manipulating, iterating, exploring, and improving.

The world needs more variety — not less. And together, we all get better.
Therefore, we’d like to ask: How might the PIE recipe be adapted to meet your community’s needs?

Maybe you could…
- Use the PIE recipe to create an environment that focuses on companies engaged in services-based businesses — read “not candidates for equity investment.” Maybe you could create ways to better meet their unique business needs? And maybe you could create entirely new ways of investing in and evaluating these companies? You could. Because that’s exactly what Oregon Story Board is doing with the PIE recipe, as it accelerates companies in the world of digital storytelling. All of which enabled them to be among Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, UC Berkeley, and Virginia Tech as an early stage grantee for Microsoft HoloLens.
- Leverage the PIE model to focus on issues that are adversely impacting your community. Like lack of inclusion. And ineffective support for women founders. Maybe you could use it to raise the visibility of a whole ton of awesome founders from communities of color? Maybe this effort could be part of a broader economic plan to make your entire community a better place to live? You could. Because that’s how the Portland Development Commission is adapting the PIE recipe to guide and accelerate companies in the Startup PDX Challenge.
- Identify the compelling knowledge and resources your community has accumulated. And look for ways to activate that knowledge by using an a PIE-flavored accelerator to focus that energy. That expertise could be geographical. It could be cultural. It could be the business environment, itself. You could. Because that’s exactly what the town of Newberg, Oregon — the gateway to the Willamette Valley wine country — is doing with the Newberg Innovation Accelerator, a project that will focus efforts on agricultural technology projects and businesses that directly impact the wine industry.
- Use the PIE recipe as means of changing the way employees approach, attack, and resolve problems within a corporation. You could bring a cross-functional team of folks from throughout the company to a shared communal workspace that resembles an accelerator. To work for three months on an entrenched problem, free from the typical approval cycles and sacred cows of corporate life. To get them out of the building and get them engaged with real customers. To hear, firsthand, how they can fix things. You could. Because that’s exactly what Daimler did with their SPIN program, by using the PIE recipe to create an internal accelerator. For employees.

Or maybe you could come up with something completely unique. Maybe you could use the PIE recipe to build new curricula at a college. Or to create a nonprofit accelerator. Or to change the dynamic of an R&D shop. Or to rethink craft brewing. Or to create agencies. Or to help Kickstarter projects survive, post funding. Or to change the world of VR. Or to help bloggers build better business models. Or to give artists an environment to create. Or to help a diverse slice of indie game developers change the face of gaming. Or to build a maker space. Or to help lifestyle companies succeed more efficiently. Or or or or…

The point is that the PIE Cookbook is designed to inspire you to do something. To help you frame up your organization, your community, and yourself. To give you a pattern for what success might look like. And how to budget for chaos, random constructive collisions, and innovation. To get creative. Not repetitive.
The PIE Cookbook is designed to help provide a framework and some confidence. To give you courage. To provide suggestions and inspiration. It’s designed to help you understand — or to educate your superiors — that it’s actually okay to try this stuff. To show them it’s not just acceptable to participate, but it’s exciting and critical to survival as well. The PIE Cookbook is our way of telling you to step off that cliff and go for it.

Not interested in building a generic tech startup accelerator? Good. Please don’t. Go do something more interesting than that.

And, by all means, please keep us in the loop. We’re looking forward to learning from — and with — you.
